### Cave mapping

The understanding of speleogenesis is based on the synthesis of information garnered in caves.
Each observation can be placed and interpreted in its spatial context and interrelation with other cave markers.
I take an active part in the production of highly detailed 2D maps or 3D models from laser based measurements.

My active projects include compiling large datasets of cave maps from 

 - Karwendel, north of Innsbruck
 - System Migovec, NW Slovenia
 - HÃ¶llengebirge
