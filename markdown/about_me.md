	Hello there! I'm an Earth Scientist trained in geology, data science and paleoclimate. 
	
	I explore, map and monitor ice caves in the European Alps.
	I'm interested to see how we can interpret past climate signals captured by the ice as it was deposited.
	
	These objects are threatened by changes in temperature and precipitation patterns in the alpine environment.
	There is a risk that those archives will disappear from the Alps before long. 
	Before that happens, we need to better understand the forcings of cave ice accumulation and the response of caves to a changing, warming climate.  

	My current job at the University of Innbruck involves the evaluation of the suitability of several cave sites for targeted research and preservation procedures.

### Cave mapping

The understanding of speleogenesis is based on the synthesis of information garnered in caves.
Each observation can be placed and interpreted in its spatial context and interrelation with other cave markers.
I take an active part in the production of highly detailed 2D maps or 3D models from laser based measurements.
