### Cave description

Tremml schacht  (cadastral code: 1744:413) is a cave located in the Hochschwab plateau in Styria.
This vertical pit, developed in the lagoonal facies of the Wetterstein limestone [@plan2004spelaologische; @bryda2010eisenerz101] opens at an elevation of 1910 m a.s.l. with a first shaft of approx 100 m to the firn surface. 
The sloping surface drops about 20 m to a lip, over which it is possible to abseil a further 40  m to the accessible base of the ice deposit.
This cliff contains thick layers poor in woody macro-remains. 
The cave was first fully explored and surveyed in 2002, at a time when the ice surface was recorded as being 75 m below the lip of the entrance [@plan2003neueentdeckte].
In 2019, the distance to the ice surface was measured again and found to reach 95 m below the lip of the cave on average, corresponding to a loss of 1500-2000 m$^3$. 
This corresponds to 25-35% volume loss, given the currently known ice volume. 
The currently accessible topmost section of the ice must therefore predate 2002 by several years, if not decades.
Near the base of the ice shaft, two layers richer in organic matter could be sampled for macro-remains (samples TREM-1 and TREM-2).
