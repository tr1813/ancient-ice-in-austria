### Cave description

Guffert Eisschacht (cadastral code: 1262/9, hereafter Guffert) is located in a shallow valley running NE-SW between the peaks of Guffertspitze to the west and Guffertstein (1963 m a.s.l.) to the east.
This 41 m deep cave is developed entirely in south dipping Wetterstein limestone [@spoetl2021guffertkarst].
Entrance *a* (to the south) opens at an elevation of 1825 m a.s.l. and has the geometry of a large 10 x 5 m funnel, which collects winter snow. 
The ice stratigraphy is particularly well developed in the lowest part of the *Eisschacht*, where layers are rather coarse. 
Further progress below the ice body leads to a small ice alcove exhibiting a thin, densely layered ice sequence with abundant woody macro-remains.

The ice stratigraphy of Guffert ice cave is thus split between and _bottom_ and _top_ sequence. 
The deepest, accessible part of the cave (-41 m) is a small $1$ m high alcove where the contact between the ice body and the underlying cobble-sized scree floor is in evidence.
Dense, laterally continuous, sub-parallel layers ranging from sub-centimetre to centimetre scale, containing numerous woody macro-remains.
The ice is transparent and likely heavily recrystallised.
This short, condensed sequence covers a stratigraphic height of $\approx 1$ m, where 7 samples were radiocarbon dated.



Moving up through the cave, the base and middle-part of the _Eisschacht_ make a $\approx 14$ m tall _top_ sequence.
The _Eisschacht_ is a roughly cylindrical, vertical pit whose circumference is almost entirely made of ice. 
Only the eastern wall of this pit is limestone bedrock.
The cliff which developed opposite the water inlet from the eastern wall by ice retreat shows a well developed layered stratigraphy. 
The water inlet is active from spring to autumn and its spray contributes to the near-cylindrical geometry of the ice pit. 
The stratigraphy is characterised by thick 40-70 cm layers of opaque, white, isotropic, firn-derived ice.
Near the base of this sequence, faint and smaller-scale layering highlights alternating firn-derived layers with recrystallised lenses.
The latter contain one visible patch of cryogenic cave carbonates. 
Laterally continuous macro-remain rich layers dip generally toward the east at an angle ranging between 30-50Â°. 
The geometry of the ice body in the upper part of the _Eisschacht_ is heavily influenced by seasonal variations in snow height, which are on the order of $\pm 5$ m.
