### Cave description

Eisgruben Eishöhle (cadastral code: 1611/39, hereafter Eisgruben) is located in Upper Austria on the western slopes of this massif, about 700 m southwest of the summit of Hoher Sarstein (1975 m a.s.l).
The cave is developed entirely within well bedded Dachstein reef limestones of upper Triassic age [@schaeffer1982badischl96].
Eisgruben is an inclined cave with a single entrance containing a spectacular ice deposit, whose volume is estimated at $7 \times 10 ^3$.
The prominent ice layering encountered at *Steinlawinenschacht* and further down in *Eiszungendom* warranted detailed radiocarbon sampling (Figure 2).

The orginal detailed survey of the cave carried out in 1982, as well as photographic evidence from that time attest to the presence of sizeable firn deposit within *Weißdom*.
It was necessary to abseil 10 m between the bedrock wall and firn to reach the *Sesam* and the cave beyond.
Survey marks painted onto the cave wall in the 80's lay in 2021 some 10 m above a debris talus free of firn.

 _The Eisgruben ice cliff_


The _Steinlawinenschacht_ ice cliff of Eisgruben (Figure 7a) is a 22 m high, overhanging outcrop, where regular, decimetre-scale ice layering is exposed by the retreat of the ice wall.
The ice pit bells out in its lower part, which is characterised by prominent laterally continuous, macro-remain rich layers, dipping at a gentle 20-25° to the NE. 
Wood-rich layers become scarcer moving up the stratigraphic column and disappear entirely after about 4 m height, giving way the clean, regularly spaced layers of the ice pit.
The ice in _Steinlawinenschacht_ has a mixed origin, with few but prominent white/opaque layers of clear firn origin intercalated with blueish, transparent layers, especially near the top of the ice pit. 
Firn-derived layers are more common in the vicinity of the wood-rich horizons, where their thickness varies between 10-50 cm.
Three of the prominent wood rich layers occur at major angular unconformities in the ice stratigraphy (Figure 7b).
By rappelling down the _Steinlawinenschacht_, one sequence could be sampled to the right hand-side (SW) of the outcrop. 
Due to the moderate dip of the layers, a second diagonal transect could be made on the left hand-side (NE) of the outcrop.
