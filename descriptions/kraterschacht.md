# Kraterschacht

Kraterschacht (cadastral code: 1651/24) is a nearly 250 m deep cave located in the Sengsengebirge of Upper Austria [@weissmair1995kraterschacht]. 
Its entrance elevation is 1530 m a.s.l.
The cave is predominantly vertical, its 100 m deep entrance pit leads to an elongated chamber hosting about 150,000 m$^3$
Kraterschacht was discovered in 1990 and surveyed in 1994; changes of the geometry of the ice deposit hosted in this cave have been observed on several occasions since [@weissmair2011kraterschacht].
The ice body was split shortly before 2003 by a 15 m wide crevasse, preventing access to the _Eiswallschacht_.
The ice level in 2009 had dropped 20 m below a pair of anchor points placed in the cave between 1990 and 1993, now inaccessible. 
The collapse of a part of the ice body, dated to no later than 2009, led to the deposition of approx 1000 m$^3$ of ice at a depth of 240 m, still observable today. 
Between 1992 and 2009, @weissmair2011kraterschacht estimated a decrease of about 6% of the total ice volume  from these observations.

A pilot sample extracted in 2009 yielded an 14c-age of 886Â±45 $^{14}$C yrs BP. 
Four more samples were taken during another reconnaissance mission in 2018. 
The main ice wall extends over 50 m in height in the lower part of the cave, with faint, sub-horizontal regular layering in evidence at its base [@weissmair2011kraterschacht].
