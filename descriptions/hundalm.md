Hundalm Tropfstein- und Eish√∂hle, hereafter Hundalm, is a cave located in the Brandenberg Alps of Tyrol, opening at an elevation of 1520 m a.s.l.,  within a spruce and larch forest [@spotl2014hundalm].
It is 55 m deep overall, with a deep ice-free gallery separated from the main body of the ice cave by an air lock.
The cave contains two openings, the *Oberer-* and *Unterer Einsteig*, respectively, which join in the ice bearing chamber called *Eisdom* at a depth of 28 m. 
Along the southern prt of the cave, several metres of congelation ice can be readily seen.


Some more data here.
Layered firn-derived ice is well exposed along the northern parts of the touristic cave trail, in particular near the deepest ice-bearing section of the cave (*Tiefster Punkt*).
These parts were sampled in detail by @spotl2014hundalm, retrieving 19 individual dates.  
The ice section situated in the northern sector of the cave [Figure 5, @spotl2014hundalm] has been resampled since, with 5 additional radiocarbon dates helping construct a new age-depth model.
This 12 m wide section contrasts with the more southerly parts of the ice body by its consistent layering and normal i.e., upwards younging, stratigraphic progression.
