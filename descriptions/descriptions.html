<h1 id="bärenloch-eishöhle">Bärenloch Eishöhle</h1>
<p>The main entrance of Bärenloch Eishöhle (cadastral code: 1742/54, hereafter Bärenloch), opens at an elevation of 1518 m a.s.l. at the southwestern end of the Bärenloch, with a commanding view over the Gsoll valley. The cave is developed in the Grafensteig limestone of early Triassic age <span class="citation" data-cites="bryda2010eisenerz101">(Bryda and van Husen, 2010)</span>, which locally dips gently to the north. Bärenloch has four surveyed entrances; of those, entrance <em>b</em> has the largest opening, and it is proximal to the ice body (Figure 2). The main ice bearing chamber in this cave is oriented roughly N-S. The earliest report of the ice levels in this cave was written up by <span class="citation" data-cites="sahlender1883baerenloch">Sahlender (1883)</span>, observing that the entire floor of this chamber was comprised of mirror-like hard ice with its surface dipping at a very shallow 2° (azimuth: 030°) towards the northern end of the chamber. There a crevice leading deeper into the cave was noted but not descended. At this place, a couple of short drops between rock and ice lead to a sucession of small rooms where the ice stratigraphy is particularly well exposed. Compared to the most recent ice level survey carried out in 2018 (Figure X), the size of the crevice has greatly increased, going so far as to allow ample access to the lower parts of the cave. Between the summers of 2018 and 2019, a retreat of <span class="math inline"> ≈ 1<em>m</em></span> of the ice wall was noted. Using the observations and measurements of <span class="citation" data-cites="sahlender1883baerenloch">Sahlender (1883)</span>, the 1883 ice level may have been higher by as much as 10 m than the top of the uppermost ice section at present.</p>
<p>Bärenloch hosts an ice body of modest dimensions (<span class="math inline">≈</span> 22 m thick) whose geometry splits the main accessible stratigraphy in three segments, each modelled as a separate sequence. A visit to the cave during the summer 2020 allowed for the first time access to the lowermost part of the ice body, a small alcove in the ice, whose floor is made of angular cobbles, at a depth of -40 m below entrance <em>b</em>. There, the ice stratigraphy is made up of 1-5 cm thick layers containing numerous small organic macro-remains, including twigs, cone fragments and very occasionally small branches (&lt; 10 cm in length). The ice itself has a granular texture, and is mostly opaque. The average crystal size is below to 1 cm, suggesting a firn-origin.</p>
<p>The middle section, measuring about 4 metres high, is exposed on the north-east face of the ice body. On this relatively clean ice section, only few wood fragments are included within sub-horizontal, decimetre size layers. The ice is largely white and opaque, with cm-sized crystals indicative of a largely firn-ice origin.</p>
<p>The third studied section in Bärenloch ice cave is located in the so-called <em>Östlicher Eishohlraum</em> (“easterly ice alcove”). This section is located at the foot of a 20 m pit called <em>Eisschacht</em> and covers an area of about 5 x 3 m, where prominent organic-rich layers are in evidence. This section is marked by a prominent transition between two ice zones. The bottom section of ice is made up of organic rich layers on average 1-2 cm thick. Above the irregular transition, ice is organised in thick decimetre sized layers with far fewer organic inclusions.</p>
<h1 id="eisgruben-eishöhle">Eisgruben Eishöhle</h1>
<p>Eisgruben Eishöhle (cadastral code: 1611/39, hereafter Eisgruben) is located in Upper Austria on the western slopes of this massif, about 700 m southwest of the summit of Hoher Sarstein (1975 m a.s.l). The cave is developed entirely within well bedded Dachstein reef limestones of upper Triassic age <span class="citation" data-cites="schaeffer1982badischl96">(Schäffer, 1982)</span>. Eisgruben is an inclined cave with a single entrance containing a spectacular ice deposit, whose volume is estimated at <span class="math inline">7 × 10<sup>3</sup></span>. The prominent ice layering encountered at <em>Steinlawinenschacht</em> and further down in <em>Eiszungendom</em> warranted detailed radiocarbon sampling (Figure 2).</p>
<p>The orginal detailed survey of the cave carried out in 1982, as well as photographic evidence from that time attest to the presence of sizeable firn deposit within <em>Weißdom</em>. It was necessary to abseil 10 m between the bedrock wall and firn to reach the <em>Sesam</em> and the cave beyond. Survey marks painted onto the cave wall in the 80’s lay in 2021 some 10 m above a debris talus free of firn.</p>
<p>The <em>Steinlawinenschacht</em> ice cliff of Eisgruben (Figure 7a) is a 22 m high, overhanging outcrop, where regular, decimetre-scale ice layering is exposed by the retreat of the ice wall. The ice pit bells out in its lower part, which is characterised by prominent laterally continuous, macro-remain rich layers, dipping at a gentle 20-25° to the NE. Wood-rich layers become scarcer moving up the stratigraphic column and disappear entirely after about 4 m height, giving way the clean, regularly spaced layers of the ice pit. The ice in <em>Steinlawinenschacht</em> has a mixed origin, with few but prominent white/opaque layers of clear firn origin intercalated with blueish, transparent layers, especially near the top of the ice pit. Firn-derived layers are more common in the vicinity of the wood-rich horizons, where their thickness varies between 10-50 cm. Three of the prominent wood rich layers occur at major angular unconformities in the ice stratigraphy (Figure 7b). By rappelling down the <em>Steinlawinenschacht</em>, one sequence could be sampled to the right hand-side (SW) of the outcrop. Due to the moderate dip of the layers, a second diagonal transect could be made on the left hand-side (NE) of the outcrop.</p>
<h1 id="großer-naturschacht">Großer Naturschacht</h1>
<p>Großer Naturschacht (cadastral code: 3741/8, hereafter Naturschacht) is located at the western edge of the Villacher Alpe, close to the Dobratsch summit (2166 m a.s.l.), in a shallow valley called Bärental. The single entrance of Naturschacht opens at an elevation of 1985 m a.s.l. <span class="citation" data-cites="jenatschke1968dobratsch">(Jenatscke, 1968)</span>. The cave is chiefly developed in Wetterstein limestone <span class="citation" data-cites="anderle1977arnoldstein200">(Anderle, 1977)</span>. Inclined ice layers with prominent woody macro-remains are well developed in this cave, starting from a depth of about 50 m at the <em>Rutschbahn</em>, and continuing to the bottom of the cave in the <em>Eisdom</em> (Figure 2). Those parts of Naturschacht were the main targets of radiocarbon samples. The <em>Rutschbahn</em> sequence of Naturschacht is presented below. The ice is exposed on the side of the cave passage leading to the deeper part of Naturschacht, on a distance of 15 m. There, the stratigraphy is chiefly comprised of firn-derived ice, opaque and isotropic. Organic-rich layers are few and far between, laterally discontinuous, so the ice deposit layers reach up to 1 m thickness and strata are generally inclined at a 40-50° angle towards the north. Along the few apparent wood rich layers, several conspicuous branches or large twigs partly encased in the ice body are in evidence. Between these layers, the macro-remain poor ice includes rare twigs or pine cone fragments, as well as lenses of recrystallised ice.</p>
<p>In the <em>Weißer Dom</em> area, another section of ice stratigraphy can be observed. The ice of this section exhibits decimetre-scale layers, markedly darker than above, which has undergone a larger degree of recrystallisation. There, wood fragments are rare, and laterally continuous wood-rich layers are entirely absent.</p>
<h1 id="guffert-eisschacht">Guffert Eisschacht</h1>
<p>Guffert Eisschacht (cadastral code: 1262/9, hereafter Guffert) is located in a shallow valley running NE-SW between the peaks of Guffertspitze to the west and Guffertstein (1963 m a.s.l.) to the east. This 41 m deep cave is developed entirely in south dipping Wetterstein limestone <span class="citation" data-cites="spoetl2021guffertkarst">(Spötl et al., 2021)</span>. Entrance <em>a</em> (to the south) opens at an elevation of 1825 m a.s.l. and has the geometry of a large 10 x 5 m funnel, which collects winter snow. The ice stratigraphy is particularly well developed in the lowest part of the <em>Eisschacht</em>, where layers are rather coarse. Further progress below the ice body leads to a small ice alcove exhibiting a thin, densely layered ice sequence with abundant woody macro-remains.</p>
<p>The ice stratigraphy of Guffert ice cave is thus split between and <em>bottom</em> and <em>top</em> sequence. The deepest, accessible part of the cave (-41 m) is a small <span class="math inline">1</span> m high alcove where the contact between the ice body and the underlying cobble-sized scree floor is in evidence. Dense, laterally continuous, sub-parallel layers ranging from sub-centimetre to centimetre scale, containing numerous woody macro-remains. The ice is transparent and likely heavily recrystallised. This short, condensed sequence covers a stratigraphic height of <span class="math inline"> ≈ 1</span> m, where 7 samples were radiocarbon dated.</p>
Moving up through the cave, the base and middle-part of the <em>Eisschacht</em> make a <span class="math inline"> ≈ 14</span> m tall <em>top</em> sequence. The <em>Eisschacht</em> is a roughly cylindrical, vertical pit whose circumference is almost entirely made of ice. Only the eastern wall of this pit is limestone bedrock. The cliff which developed opposite the water inlet from the eastern wall by ice retreat shows a well developed layered stratigraphy. The water inlet is active from spring to autumn and its spray contributes to the near-cylindrical geometry of the ice pit. The stratigraphy is characterised by thick 40-70 cm layers of opaque, white, isotropic, firn-derived ice. Near the base of this sequence, faint and smaller-scale layering highlights alternating firn-derived layers with recrystallised lenses. The latter contain one visible patch of cryogenic cave carbonates. Laterally continuous macro-remain rich layers dip generally toward the east at an angle ranging between 30-50°. The geometry of the ice body in the upper part of the <em>Eisschacht</em> is heavily influenced by seasonal variations in snow height, which are on the order of <span class="math inline"> ± 5</span> m.

<h1 id="hochschneid-eishöhle">Hochschneid Eishöhle</h1>
<p>Hochschneid Eishöhle (cadastral code: 1567/172, hereafter Hochschneid) is found a short distance off the <em>Kaiserweg</em>, a well-trodden alpine trail running along the southern fringe of the Höllengebirge, between Hochschneid summit (1752 m a.s.l.) and Helmeskogel (1636 m a.s.l.). This 163 m deep cave is developed in Wetterstein limestone of middle Triassic age <span class="citation" data-cites="egger1996gmunden66">(Egger, 1996)</span> and contains a large snow and ice deposit <span class="citation" data-cites="wielander2019hoellengebirge">(Wielander et al., 2019)</span>, whose volume is estimated at <span class="math inline">4 × 10<sup>3</sup></span> (cf. Table 1). Hochschneid possesses two entrances of markedly different opening diameter and elevation. In practice, it is entrance (a), <em>Nebelmonsterdoline</em>, with its 40 x 20 m size, which provides the main pathway for snow input into the cave (Figure 3a). Hochschneid hosts the largest ice volume out of all the sites under consideration. The lowermost part of the ice body (the <em>Iglu</em>) exhibits a clear layered stratigraphy, which was sampled for radiocarbon dating (Figure 3b).</p>
The <em>Iglu</em> outcrop is a <span class="math inline"> ≈ 10</span> m wide and <span class="math inline"> ≈ 4</span> m high ice cliff made up of steeply inclined, faint ice strata, separated by sub-parallel horizons rich in woody macro-remains. The ice is generally opaque and made up of isotropic crystals; the outcrop ice is generally strongly reflective and white in appearance (Figure 3b). The large scale layering in the outcrop is picked out by the macro-remain rich layers, whose thickness ranges between 10-70 cm. Faint layering in the macro-fossil poor sections ranges between sub-cm to multi-cm scale. Whilst the layering in the <em>Iglu</em> is near vertical, the examination of the entire ice pit (about 40 m in height), reveals that layer thickness increases upwards, while dip decreases markedly, reaching near horizontal values in the <em>Hüttenwirtehalle</em>. In the <em>Iglu</em> section, the younging direction is to the left, i.e., from North to South, which agrees with orientation of entrance <em>a</em>’s major axis.

<h1 id="hundalm-tropfstein--und-eishöhle">Hundalm Tropfstein- und Eishöhle</h1>
<p>Hundalm Tropfstein- und Eishöhle, hereafter Hundalm, is a cave located in the Brandenberg Alps of Tyrol, opening at an elevation of 1520 m a.s.l., within a spruce and larch forest <span class="citation" data-cites="spotl2014hundalm">(Spötl et al., 2014)</span>. It is 55 m deep overall, with a deep ice-free gallery separated from the main body of the ice cave by an air lock. The cave contains two openings, the <em>Oberer-</em> and <em>Unterer Einsteig</em>, respectively, which join in the ice bearing chamber called <em>Eisdom</em> at a depth of 28 m. Layered firn-derived ice is well exposed along the northern parts of the touristic cave trail, in particular near the deepest ice-bearing section of the cave (<em>Tiefster Punkt</em>). These parts were sampled in detail by <span class="citation" data-cites="spotl2014hundalm">Spötl et al. (2014)</span>, retrieving 19 individual dates.<br />
The ice section situated in the northern sector of the cave <span class="citation" data-cites="spotl2014hundalm">(Figure 5, Spötl et al., 2014)</span> has been resampled since, with 5 additional radiocarbon dates helping construct a new age-depth model. This 12 m wide section contrasts with the more southerly parts of the ice body by its consistent layering and normal i.e., upwards younging, stratigraphic progression.</p>
<h1 id="kraterschacht">Kraterschacht</h1>
<p>Kraterschacht (cadastral code: 1651/24) is a nearly 250 m deep cave located in the Sengsengebirge of Upper Austria <span class="citation" data-cites="weissmair1995kraterschacht">(Weißmair, 1995)</span>. Its entrance elevation is 1530 m a.s.l. The cave is predominantly vertical, its 100 m deep entrance pit leads to an elongated chamber hosting about 150,000 m<span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> Kraterschacht was discovered in 1990 and surveyed in 1994; changes of the geometry of the ice deposit hosted in this cave have been observed on several occasions since <span class="citation" data-cites="weissmair2011kraterschacht">(Weißmair, 2011)</span>. The ice body was split shortly before 2003 by a 15 m wide crevasse, preventing access to the <em>Eiswallschacht</em>. The ice level in 2009 had dropped 20 m below a pair of anchor points placed in the cave between 1990 and 1993, now inaccessible. The collapse of a part of the ice body, dated to no later than 2009, led to the deposition of approx 1000 m<span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> of ice at a depth of 240 m, still observable today. Between 1992 and 2009, <span class="citation" data-cites="weissmair2011kraterschacht">Weißmair (2011)</span> estimated a decrease of about 6% of the total ice volume from these observations.</p>
<p>A pilot sample extracted in 2009 yielded an 14c-age of 886±45 <span class="math inline"><sup>14</sup></span>C yrs BP. Four more samples were taken during another reconnaissance mission in 2018. The main ice wall extends over 50 m in height in the lower part of the cave, with faint, sub-horizontal regular layering in evidence at its base <span class="citation" data-cites="weissmair2011kraterschacht">(Weißmair, 2011)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="tremml-413">Tremml-413</h1>
<p>Tremml schacht (cadastral code: 1744:413) is a cave located in the Hochschwab plateau in Styria. This vertical pit, developed in the lagoonal facies of the Wetterstein limestone <span class="citation" data-cites="plan2004spelaologische bryda2010eisenerz101">(Bryda and van Husen, 2010; Plan, 2004)</span> opens at an elevation of 1910 m a.s.l. with a first shaft of approx 100 m to the firn surface. The sloping surface drops about 20 m to a lip, over which it is possible to abseil a further 40 m to the accessible base of the ice deposit. This cliff contains thick layers poor in woody macro-remains. The cave was first fully explored and surveyed in 2002, at a time when the ice surface was recorded as being 75 m below the lip of the entrance <span class="citation" data-cites="plan2003neueentdeckte">(Plan, 2003)</span>. In 2019, the distance to the ice surface was measured again and found to reach 95 m below the lip of the cave on average, corresponding to a loss of 1500-2000 m<span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span>. This corresponds to 25-35% volume loss, given the currently known ice volume. The currently accessible topmost section of the ice must therefore predate 2002 by several years, if not decades. Near the base of the ice shaft, two layers richer in organic matter could be sampled for macro-remains (samples TREM-1 and TREM-2).</p>
