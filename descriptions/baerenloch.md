### Cave description 

The main entrance of Bärenloch Eishöhle (cadastral code: 1742/54, hereafter Bärenloch), opens at an elevation of 1518 m a.s.l. at the southwestern end of the Bärenloch, with a commanding view over the Gsoll valley. 
The cave is developed in the Grafensteig limestone of early Triassic age [@bryda2010eisenerz101], which locally dips gently to the north. 
Bärenloch has four surveyed entrances; of those, entrance *b* has the largest opening, and it is proximal to the ice body (Figure 2).
The main ice bearing chamber in this cave is oriented roughly N-S. 
The earliest report of the ice levels in this cave was written up by @sahlender1883baerenloch, observing that the entire floor of this chamber was comprised of mirror-like hard ice with its surface dipping at a very shallow 2° (azimuth: 030°) towards the northern end of the chamber.
There a crevice leading deeper into the cave was noted but not descended. 
At this place, a couple of short drops between rock and ice lead to a sucession of small rooms where the ice stratigraphy is particularly well exposed.
Compared to the most recent ice level survey carried out in 2018 (Figure X), the size of the crevice has greatly increased, going so far as to allow ample access to the lower parts of the cave. Between the summers of 2018 and 2019, a retreat of $\approx 1 m$ of the ice wall was noted.
Using the observations and measurements of @sahlender1883baerenloch, the 1883 ice level may have been higher by as much as 10 m than the top of the uppermost ice section at present.

Bärenloch hosts an ice body of modest dimensions ($\approx$ 22 m thick) whose geometry splits the main accessible stratigraphy in three segments, each modelled as a separate sequence.
A visit to the cave during the summer 2020 allowed for the first time access to the lowermost part of the ice body, a small alcove in the ice, whose floor is made of angular cobbles, at a depth of -40 m below entrance _b_.
There, the ice stratigraphy is made up of 1-5 cm thick layers containing numerous small organic macro-remains, including twigs, cone fragments and very occasionally small branches (< 10 cm in length).
The ice itself has a granular texture, and is mostly opaque. 
The average crystal size is below to 1 cm, suggesting a firn-origin.

The middle section, measuring about 4 metres high, is exposed on the north-east face of the ice body. 
On this relatively clean ice section, only few wood fragments are included within sub-horizontal, decimetre size layers.
The ice is largely white and opaque, with cm-sized crystals indicative of a largely firn-ice origin.

The third studied section in Bärenloch ice cave is located in the so-called _Östlicher Eishohlraum_ ("easterly ice alcove"). 
This section is located at the foot of a 20 m pit called _Eisschacht_ and covers an area of about 5 x 3 m, where prominent organic-rich layers are in evidence.
This section is marked by a prominent transition between two ice zones. 
The bottom section of ice is made up of organic rich layers on average 1-2 cm thick. 
Above the irregular transition, ice is organised in thick decimetre sized layers with far fewer organic inclusions.
