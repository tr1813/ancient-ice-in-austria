<h2>Welcome to the _Ancient Ice in Caves_ project!</h2>


Here we present a detailed site description of each cave studied under 'Ice caves, a threatened climate archive' project.

_Location of the cave sites under study_

## Site selection

More than 1200 ice-bearing caves are recorded in the Austrian cave cadaster, owing to the large limestone plateaus in the North Calcareous Alps, where a majority of the caves are situated at elevations ranging 1600-2100 m [@spoetlwimmer2018icecaves]. 

Potential cave study sites were screened for the presence of perennial underground ice deposits, disregarding snow pits or dolines of relatively small dimensions (< 20 m).
Ice deposits derived primarily from the accumulation and densification of snow during the cold season were preferred.
These are found for the most part in sag-type caves, i.e. cavities with a descending geometry allowing solid precipitation to enter the cave directly.

Within the Austrian cave database, sites containing a clearly visible and accessible stratigraphy, where the presence of wood debris was attested from previous speleological documentation, made the best targets.
In some cases, the ice deposits and their woody content were striking enough, that targeted that pilot radiocarbon dating or pollen-based age estimation were already performed, as in the case of Eisgruben Eishöhle [@achleitner1995alter]. 

In all, eight objects were selected: 

1. [Guffert Eisschacht (Tyrol)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/guffert.html)
2. [Bärenloch Eishöhle (Styria)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/baerenloch.html)
3. [Eisgruben Eishöhle (Upper Austria)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/eisgruben.html)
4. [Hochschneid Eishöhle (Upper Austria)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/hochschneid.html)
5. [Großer Naturschacht (Carinthia)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/grosser-naturschacht.html)
6. [Hundalm Tropfstein-und Eishöhle (Tyrol)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/hundalm.html)
7. [Kraterschacht (Styria)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/kraterschacht.html)
8. [Tremml-schacht (Styria)](https://tr1813.github.io/ancient-ice-in-austria/descriptions/tremml.html)

The five caves are found between 1470 m and 2100 m a.s.l. and represent local permafrost phenomena located well below the altitude of their respective 0°C isotherm.
Their steeply descending geometry the ice bearing part of the presented caves requires speleological rope technique.

For each cave possessing more than one entrance, one single large opening could be identified as responsible for the near-majority of snow input during winter.
A short description of the location and specific geometry of each of these study sites is given below, together with an overview of their ice deposit and an estimation of their respective ice volumes (Table 1).
