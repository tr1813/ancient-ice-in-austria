	abstract = {The reasons for the early Holocene temperature discrepancy between northern hemispheric model simulations and paleoclimate reconstructions{\textemdash}known as the Holocene temperature conundrum{\textemdash}remain unclear. Using hydrogen isotopes of fluid inclusion water extracted from stalagmites from the Milandre Cave in Switzerland, we established a mid-latitude European mean annual temperature reconstruction for the past 14,000 years. Our Milandre Cave fluid inclusion temperature record (MC-FIT) resembles Greenland and Mediterranean sea surface temperature trends but differs from recent reconstructions obtained from biogenic proxies and climate models. The water isotopes are further synchronized with tropical precipitation records, stressing the Northern Hemisphere signature. Our results support the existence of a European Holocene Thermal Maximum and data model temperature discrepancies. Moreover, data-data comparison reveals a significant latitudinal temperature gradient within Europe. Last, the MC-FIT record suggests that seasonal biases in the proxies are not the primary cause of the Holocene temperature conundrum.},

Principal component regression analysis has been performed to reconstruct monthly (AD 1659--1900) and seasonal (AD 1500--1658) temperature and precipitation fields over the land areas including Europe, North Africa and the Near East (Luterbacher 2001). The reconstructions are based on the combination of early instrumental station series (temperature, pressure and precipitation) and proxy reconstructions from Eurasian sites. The statistical relationships were derived over the 1901--1990 period and were applied to the available data prior to 1900 in order to derive the temperature and precipitation reconstructions back to AD 1500.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACTLong-term measurements of atmospheric Δ14CO2 from two monitoring stations, one in the European Alps (Jungfraujoch, Switzerland) and the other in the Black Forest (Schauinsland, Germany), are presented. Both records show a steady decrease, changing from about 6‰ per year at the beginning of the century to only 3‰ per year on average in the last 4 yr. A significant seasonal variation of Δ14CO2 is observed at both sites with maxima during late summer and minima in late winter/early spring. While the Δ14C maxima are similar at Jungfraujoch and Schauinsland, the minima at Schauinsland are lower by up to 10‰, due to a larger influence from 14C-free fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the footprint of the Schauinsland station in winter. Summer mean Δ14C values at Schauinsland are considered best suited as input for studies of biospheric carbon cycling in mid-northern latitudes or for dating of organic material of the last half century. },

	abstract = { This paper reviews the 210Pb dating programme carried out at the University of Liverpool over a period of three decades since its inception by Frank Oldfield in the mid-1970s. The work at Liverpool has included studies of the basic processes controlling the supply of 210Pb to the various natural archives, as well as the development of a detailed and systematic methodology for dating the environmental records in these archives. The assumption that 210Pb fallout at any given location is constant when measured on timescales of a year or more has been tested using data on 210Pb concentrations in UK rainwater spanning more than 40 years, and a simple atmospheric model developed to account for observed spatial variations in the flux over large land masses. The basic assumptions of the CRS dating model have been tested in detail using mass balance studies of fallout radionuclides in catchment/lake systems, and in general using data from a large number of separate studies. The Liverpool data base is used to illustrate the wide ranging applicability of the 210Pb dating method. Results are shown from lakes varying in size from the very small to the very large, and with sedimentation rates ranging from the very fast to the very slow. The particular difficulties of dating sediment records from Desert Lakes and Polar Regions with very low atmospheric fluxes are discussed, with unexpected results in some cases. },

@article{yonge1999isotopes,
	abstract = {Perennial ice from caves on and to the east of the Canadian Great Divide yield δ18O and δD values, which are unusually high measurements when compared with the average precipitation for the region. Furthermore, these ice data fall below and along lines of lower slope than the Global Meteoric Water Line. To explain the observed relationships, we propose the following process. A vapour-ice isotopic fractionation mechanism operates on warm-season vapour when it precipitates as hoar ice on entering the caves. The subsequent fall of hoar to the cave floor through mechanical overloading, along with ice derived from ground-water seepage (with a mean annual isotopic composition), results in massive ice formation of a mixed composition. This mixed composition is what is observed in the characteristic relationships found here. Such findings suggest that a warm versus cold climate interpretation for ancient cave ice may be the opposite of that found in the more familiar polar and glacial ice cores.},

@article{hartvani2021geostatisticalisotopes,
	abstract = {A detailed knowledge of the stable isotope signature of precipitation is the basis of investigations in a variety of scientific fields and applications. To obtain robust and reliable results, the representativity of the currently operating (at least, as of 2018) precipitation stable isotope monitoring stations across Slovenia (n = 8) and Hungary (n = 9) was evaluated on the basis of amount-weighted annual averages with the aim of revealing any redundantly (i.e. over-) represented or un(der)represented areas. In the case of the latter, optimal locations for additional sites were suggested in Slovenia and Hungary. The networks of both countries are design-based systems that need to be fine-tuned for long-term optimized operation. The evaluation of the monitoring network was performed taking into consideration the stations operating in Slovenia and Hungary, as well as closely situated ones operating in neighboring countries. The evaluation was carried out in nine different combinations, using spatial simulated annealing, with regression kriging variance as a quality measure. The results showed that (i) there are over- and un(der)represented areas in the network, an issue requiring remedial action, (ii) the mutual information exchange of the precipitation stable isotope monitoring networks of Slovenia and Hungary increases the precision of precipitation δ18O estimation by ~0.3‰ in a 15--30 km wide zone near the borders, and (iii) by an even greater degree in the neighboring countries' stations. The current research may be termed pioneering in the matter of the detailed geostatistical assessment of spatial representativity of a precipitation stable isotope monitoring network, and as such, can serve as an example for future studies aiming for the spatial optimization of other regional precipitation stable isotope monitoring networks.},

@article{gomezhernandez2013moisture,
	abstract = {In this study, seasonal and interannual variability of the main atmospheric moisture sources over eight regions in the Mediterranean basin were investigated along a 21 year period. The Lagrangian dispersion model FLEXPART, developed by Stohl and James [2004, 2005], was applied to identify the contribution of humidity to the moisture budget of each region. This methodology is used to compute budgets of evaporation minus precipitation (E − P) by calculating changes in the specific humidity along backward trajectories, for the preceding 10 day periods. The results show clear seasonal differences in the moisture sources between wet and dry seasons. The Western Mediterranean Sea is the dominant moisture source for almost all the regions in the Mediterranean basin during the wet season, while the local net evaporation dominates during the dry season. The highest interannual variability is found in contributions to the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and the Eastern Mediterranean. It is seen that the role of teleconnections is more limited than for the precipitation recorded in the region.},

@article{kern2020isotopes,
	abstract = {It is generally observed that precipitation is gradually depleted in 18O and 2H isotopes as elevation increases (`altitude' effect) or when moving inland from seacoasts (`continental' effect); the regionally accurate estimation of these large-scale effects is important in isotope hydrological or paleoclimatological applications. Nevertheless, seasonal and spatial differences should be considered. Stable isotope composition of monthly precipitation fallen between January 2016 and December 2018 was studied for selected stations situated along an elevation transect and a continental transect in order to assess the isotopic `altitude' and `continental' effects in modern precipitation across the Adriatic--Pannonian region. Isotopic characteristics argue that the main driver of the apparent vertical depletion of precipitation in heavy stable isotopes is different in summer (raindrop evaporation) and winter (condensation), although, there is no significant difference in the resulting `altitude' effect. Specifically, an `altitude' effect of −1.2‰/km for δ18O and −7.9‰/km for δ2H can be used in modern precipitation across the Adriatic--Pannonian region. Isotopic characteristics of monthly precipitation showed seasonally different patterns and suggest different isotope hydrometeorological regimes along the continental transect. While no significant decrease was found in δ18O data moving inland from the Adriatic from May to August of the year, a clear decreasing trend was found in precipitation fallen during the colder season of the year (October to March) up to a break at ~400 km inland from the Adriatic coast. The estimated mean isotopic `continental' effect for the colder season precipitation is −2.4‰/100 km in δ18O and −20‰/100 km in δ2H. A prevailing influence of the Mediterranean moisture in the colder season is detected up to this breakpoint, while the break in the δ18O data probably reflects the mixture of moisture sources with different isotopic characteristics. A sharp drop in the d-excess (&gt;3‰) at the break in precipitation δ18O trend likely indicates a sudden switch from the Mediterranean moisture domain to additional (mainly Atlantic) influence, while a gradual change in the d-excess values might suggest a gradual increase of the non-Mediterranean moisture contribution along the transect.},

@article{suric2020isotopesdripwater,
	abstract = {Speleothems deposited from cave drip waters retain, in their calcite lattice, isotopic records of past environmental changes. Among other proxies, &delta;18O is recognized as very useful for this purpose, but its accurate interpretation depends on understanding the relationship between precipitation and drip water &delta;18O, a relationship controlled by climatic settings. We analyzed water isotope data of 17 caves from different latitudes and altitudes in relatively small but diverse Croatian karst regions in order to distinguish the dominant influences. Drip water &delta;18O in colder caves generally shows a greater resemblance to the amount-weighted mean of precipitation &delta;18O compared to warmer sites, where evaporation plays an important role. However, during glacial periods, today&rsquo;s &lsquo;warm&rsquo; sites were cold, changing the cave characteristics and precipitation &delta;18O transmission patterns. Superimposed on these settings, each cave has site-specific features, such as morphology (descending or ascending passages), altitude and infiltration elevation, (micro) location (rain shadow or seaward orientation), aquifer architecture (responsible for the drip water homogenization) and cave atmosphere (governing equilibrium or kinetic fractionation). This necessitates an individual approach and thorough monitoring for best comprehension.},

	abstract = {Abstract The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen incorporated in the water molecule (18O and 2H) have become an important tool not only in Isotope Hydrology, routinely applied to study the origin and dynamics of surface and groundwaters, but also in studies related to atmospheric circulation and palaeoclimatic investigations. A proper understanding of the behaviour of these tracers in the water cycle is required for a meaningful use of these tools in any of these disciplines. Our knowledge of the vertical distribution and the factors controlling the stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in atmospheric moisture derives from a limited number of observations and vertical profiles in the atmosphere. An international programme jointly operated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and operational since 1961, has resulted in the development of a dedicated database to monitor isotope ratios in precipitation in more than 500 meteorological stations world-wide. The main features of the spatial and temporal variations of stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation and atmospheric moisture at the global scale are presented based on the analysis of limited data on water vapour, data obtained by the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) and the few observations at high latitudes.

	abstract = {Summary
The stable isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen (δ2H and δ18O) and tritium activity (3H) were monitored in monthly precipitation at two continental stations (Ljubljana, Zagreb) and six stations along the eastern Adriatic coasts of Slovenia and Croatia in the period 2001--2003. Mean air temperatures and amount of precipitation were also recorded. Distinct differences in both meteorological and isotopic data between the continental and maritime stations were observed. Seasonal variations in δ18O are smaller at the maritime stations than at the continental ones due to smaller seasonal temperature variations. A good correlation between δ18O and δ2H was obtained for each station, and the local meteoric water lines are close to the Global Meteoric Water Line, with a decreasing trend of slope for the south-Adriatic stations. Good correlations between δ18O in monthly precipitation and mean monthly air temperature were observed at all stations. The slope of δ18O vs. T varied between 0.37‰$\,^{\circ}$C−1 and 0.15‰$\,^{\circ}$C−1. Mean 3H activity and seasonal variation of 3H activity are smaller at maritime stations than at continental ones. Additionally, 3H activity decreases in the NW--SE direction of the Adriatic coast. The study of spatial variations over this relatively small area rich in geographical and climatic diversities showed the complexity of the isotopic composition of precipitation and the isotopic data obtained for eight stations, most of them in the karstic area along the Adriatic coast, and gave valuable information for regional hydrological investigations and modelling of isotope variability over the Mediterranean basin.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim  To produce a statistical stratification of the European environment, suitable for stratified random sampling of ecological resources, the selection of sites for representative studies across the continent, and to provide strata for modelling exercises and reporting. Location  A `Greater European Window' with the following boundaries: 11$\,^{\circ}$ W, 32$\,^{\circ}$ E, 34$\,^{\circ}$ N, 72$\,^{\circ}$ N. Methods  Twenty of the most relevant available environmental variables were selected, based on experience from previous studies. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to explain 88\% of the variation into three dimensions, which were subsequently clustered using an ISODATA clustering routine. The mean first principal component values of the classification variables were used to aggregate the strata into Environmental Zones and to provide a basis for consistent nomenclature. Results  The Environmental Stratification of Europe (EnS) consists of 84 strata, which have been aggregated into 13 Environmental Zones. The stratification has a 1 km2 resolution. Aggregations of the strata have been compared to other European classifications using the Kappa statistic, and show `good' comparisons. The individual strata have been described using data from available environmental databases. The EnS is available for noncommercial use by applying to the corresponding author. Main conclusions  The Environmental Stratification of Europe has been constructed using tried and tested statistical procedures. It forms an appropriate stratification for stratified random sampling of ecological resources, the selection of sites for representative studies across the continent and for the provision of strata for modelling exercises and reporting at the European scale.},

@article{davis2003pollenreconstruction,
	abstract = {We present the first area-average time series reconstructions of warmest month, coldest month and mean annual surface air temperatures across Europe during the last 12,000 years. These series are based on quantitative pollen climate reconstructions from over 500 pollen sites assimilated using an innovative four-dimensional gridding procedure. This approach combines three-dimensional spatial gridding with a fourth dimension represented by time, allowing data from irregular time series to be `focussed' onto a regular time step. We provide six regional reconstructed temperature time series as well as summary time series for the whole of Europe. The results suggest major spatial and seasonal differences in Holocene temperature trends within a remarkably balanced regional and annual energy budget. The traditional mid-Holocene thermal maximum is observed only over Northern Europe and principally during the summer. This warming was balanced by a mid-Holocene cooling over Southern Europe, whilst Central Europe occupied an intermediary position. Changes in annual mean temperatures for Europe as a whole suggest an almost linear increase in thermal budget up to 7800 BP, followed by stable conditions for the remainder of the Holocene. This early Holocene warming and later equilibrium has been mainly modulated by increasing winter temperatures in the west, which have continued to rise at a progressively decreasing rate up to the present day.},

Discrimination between environmental and anthropogenic impacts on past civilizations, however, remains difficult because of the paucity of high-resolution paleoclimatic evidence. We present tree ring{\textendash}based reconstructions of central European summer precipitation and temperature variability over the past 2500 years. Recent warming is unprecedented, but modern hydroclimatic variations may have at times been exceeded in magnitude and duration. Wet and warm summers occurred during periods of Roman and medieval prosperity. Increased climate variability from ~250 to 600 C.E. coincided with the demise of the western Roman Empire and the turmoil of the Migration Period. Such historical data may provide a basis for counteracting the recent political and fiscal reluctance to mitigate projected climate change.},

@article{belli2013climatevariability,
	abstract = {Geochemical and physical changes along the growth axis of speleothems are controlled by climate as well as the dynamics of the host karst system. Discriminating between the two is one of the major challenges in assembling robust cave palaeoclimate records. Overcoming this dilemma may be achieved by investigating multiple properties from two or more speleothems from the same cave, spanning the same time interval. In this study, we use high-resolution stable oxygen and carbon isotope (δ13C and δ18O), morphological and petrographic data from two calcite stalagmites (SV1 and SV7) from Grotta Savi, Italy, to help constraining the regional climate conditions during the Younger Dryas. The new SV1 record, spanning 15.3--9.4 ka, builds on a previously published low-resolution stable isotope time series. It is anchored by 22 new U--Th ages and lamina-counting, yielding a refined age model that supersedes the previous one. The SV7 record is anchored by 8 U--Th ages and spans 13.1--10.5 ka, partially overlapping the SV1 record. Together, the morphological and geochemical characteristics of SV1 and SV7 allow us to identify site-specific processes driving the isotopic variations. This enables us to explore the degree of complacency in speleothems whereby, periodically, a speleothem is insensitive to recording a climate signal, due to aquifer hydrology and network evolution. The model suggests that δ18O is a proxy for the infiltration amount that reaches the site of deposition, which, in the case of SV7, was buffered by the aquifer hydrology. The interpretation of δ13C in both stalagmites is more complex, being influenced by both temperature and hydrology. Only a comparison of the two stalagmite records allows us to recognise a decoupling between the effects of hydrology and temperature. According to our interpretation, the most distinctive climate information of the Younger Dryas was the high hydrological variability, with phases dominated by seasonal infiltration within an overall cooling trend. Our record also reveals a significant Early Holocene climate anomaly -- centred at 10.4 ka -- whose magnitude was possibly amplified by local synoptic conditions. Our research demonstrates the importance of investigating several complementary proxies, particularly from morphologically diverse stalagmites. When monitoring data are not available, fabric and lamina thickness can be fundamental to unravelling the dominant control of hydrology or temperature on stable isotopes.},

The growth interval of the speleothems based on U-Th dating covers the period from 4.4 ka to 1.5 ka. Both speleothems show frequent δ18O and δ13C fluctuations with similar average values (δ18O value of -4‰ for both speleothems; and average value of δ13C-8.5‰ and −8.8‰, respectively). In order to reconstruct the Holocene climatic conditions in the Eastern Adriatic, the speleothem isotopic record is discussed and compared with other Holocene records. They reveal periods of drought which occurred at 4.3--4 ka and around 3.5 ka, with relatively wet phases between. From 3 ka, there is a general trend towards dryness as evidentiated by the relatively high δ18O values of -3.5‰ to -2.5‰ recorded in speleothem SPD-1. There is distinct trend of drying during the Roman Warm Period and further toward the Dark Age Cold Period (DACP) with shorter periods of wetter conditions. These changes coincide well with the other records, thus revealing regional events along the Eastern Adriatic.},

	abstract = {Abstract The European Alps are very sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. Recent improvements in Alpine glacier length records and climate reconstructions from annually laminated sediments of Alpine Lake Silvaplana give the opportunity to investigate the relationship between these two data sets of Alpine climate. Two different time frames are considered: the last 500--1000 years as well as the last 7400 years. First, we found good agreement between the two different climate archives during the past millennium: mass accumulation rates and biogenic silica concentration are largely in phase with the glacier length changes of Mer de Glace and Unterer Grindelwaldgletscher, and with the records of glacier length of Grosser Aletschgletscher and Gornergletscher. Secondly, the records are compared with temporally highly resolved data of solar activity. The Sun has had a major impact on the Alpine climate variations in the long term, i.e. several centuries to millennia. Solar activity varies with the Hallstatt periodicity of about 2000 years. Hallstatt minima are identified around 500, 2500 and 5000 a. Around these times grand solar minima (such as the Maunder Minimum) occurred in clusters coinciding with colder Alpine climate expressed by glacier advances. During the Hallstatt maxima around 0, 2000 and 4500 a, the Alpine glaciers generally retreated, indicating a warmer climate. This is supported by archaeological findings at Schnidejoch, a transalpine pass in Switzerland that was only accessible when glaciers had retreated. On shorter timescales, however, the influence of the Sun cannot be as easily detected in Alpine climate change, indicating that in addition to solar forcing, volcanic influence and internal climate variations have played an important role.

The OWDA matches historical accounts of severe drought and wetness with a spatial completeness not previously available. In addition, megadroughts reconstructed over north-central Europe in the 11th and mid-15th centuries reinforce other evidence from North America and Asia that droughts were more severe, extensive, and prolonged over Northern Hemisphere land areas before the 20th century, with an inadequate understanding of their causes. The OWDA provides new data to determine the causes of Old World drought and wetness and attribute past climate variability to forced and/or internal variability.},

	abstract = {The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the major atmospheric mode that controls winter European climate variability because its strength and phase determine regional temperature, precipitation and storm tracks. The NAO spatial structure and associated climatic impacts over Europe are not stationary making it crucial to understanding its past evolution in order to improve the predictability of future scenarios. In this regard, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies aimed at reconstructing past NAO variability, but the information related to decadal-scale NAO evolution beyond the last millennium is scarce and inconclusive. We present a new 2,000-year multi-annual, proxy-based reconstruction of local NAO impact, with associated uncertainties, obtained by a Bayesian approach. This new local NAO reconstruction is obtained from a mountain lacustrine sedimentary archive of the Iberian Peninsula. This geographical area is not included in previous NAO reconstructions despite being a widely used region for instrumental-based NAO measurements. We assess the main external forcings (i.e., volcanic eruptions and solar activity) on NAO variability which, on a decadal scale, show that a low number of sunspots correlate to low NAO values. By comparison with other previously published NAO reconstructions in our analyses we can test the stationarity of the solar influence on the NAO signal across a latitudinal gradient based on the position of the employed archives for each NAO reconstruction. Inconclusive results on the volcanic forcing on NAO variability over decadal time-scales indicates the need for further studies. Moreover, we highlight the potential role of other North Atlantic modes of variability (i.e., East Atlantic pattern) on the non-stationary behaviour of the NAO throughout the Common Era, likely via solar forcing.},

	abstract = {Mountain grazing and ore processing had a significant impact on the Alpine environment in the last 5000 years, but few studies have so far focused on environmental changes of the south eastern Alps. This study investigates the vegetation history and sedimentary processes in the catchment of Lake Bohinj (Julian Alps, Slovenia), where a 12-m-long core was collected in the central part of the lake. Sediment in the early Holocene section of the core was partially reworked due to a major seismic event dated to 6711--6523 yr cal BP (Rapuc et al. 2018), therefore a detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstruction was performed only for the top 4.4 m of the core. Here the results of mineralogical, sedimentological, geochemical, stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N), and pollen analysis are presented in order to better understand the impact of people (agriculture, grazing, mining) on the environment, and climate-human interactions over the last 6600 years. The results of palynological research suggest that at ca. 6000 yr cal BP Lake Bohinj was surrounded by mixed forest composed of Picea, Abies, deciduous Quercus, with Fagus becoming dominant after ca. 3300 yr cal BP. In the Bronze and especially the Iron Age (3500--2500 yr cal BP), when the region was, according to archaeological data, densely populated, clearing of forests due to agriculture, livestock production and metallurgical activities was detected through Cerealia type pollen, Plantago lanceolata, and the decline of Abies. These activities probably triggered soil erosion recorded as increased sedimentation rates. In the subsequent centuries human impact on the environment continued (increased), but it seems that the watershed was not destabilised again. Several periods of high terrigenous input were recorded at 6100--6000, 5700--5550, 5000--4600, 3900, 3700--3550, 2300--2200 yr cal BP and could be associated with a mobilisation of river inflow from the eastern flysch bearing catchment, due to river migration during periods of wetter climate.

@article{persoiu2011icestableisotopes,
	abstract = {Recently, a series of studies have targeted the stable isotopic composition of cave ice as a possible source of paleoclimatic information, but none presented an explanation for the way in which the external climatic signal is transferred to cave ice. While the relation between the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and drip water can be relatively easily determined, a more complex problem arises, i.e., the possible alteration of the primary climatic signal recorded by the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes during the freezing of water to form cave ice. Here we report the results of the first detailed investigations of the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope behavior during the formation of ice in Sc{\u a}ri{\c s}oara Ice Cave. Samples of ice align on a straight line with a slope lower than 8 in a δ18O-δ2H plot, characteristic for ice formed by the freezing of water. A model is presented for the reconstruction of the initial isotopic composition of water, despite the complexity induced by kinetic effects during early stages of freezing. These results are consistent with ice that forms by the downward freezing of a stagnant pool of water, under kinetic conditions in the initial stages of the process, and isotopic equilibrium thereafter. As ice caves are described in many parts of the world, otherwise poorly represented in ice-based paleoclimatology, the results of this study could open a new direction in paleoclimatic research so that an array of significant paleoclimate data can be developed on the basis of their study.},

@article{FEURDEAN20111,
	abstract = {Sc{\u a}ri{\c s}oara Ice Cave (NW Romania) contains the world's largest underground perennial ice deposit. In this paper we present the results from pollen, micro- and macro-charcoal, and plant macrofossil investigations of a vertical ice exposure spanning the past ca. 1000years in the Little Reservation from this cave. These results are then compared with three peat sequences close to the study area in order to evaluate the potential of using biotic remains preserved in the ice block for past vegetation, environment and climatic reconstructions. Pollen data from Sc{\u a}ri{\c s}oara Ice Cave suggest that each impurity-poor layer is likely to include a smaller number of years, compared to organic-rich layers in which repeated, multi-annual melting events may have concentrated a higher amount of organic matter. However, layers with abundant presence of organic matter and also containing plant macro-remains, micro- and macro-charcoal particles appear to indicate a rapid wash-in of surface material into the cave. Evidence from the pollen record suggests the prevalence of close forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica between ca. AD 1200 and 1500 and by Picea abies between ca. AD 1000 and 1500 and from AD 1550 onwards. Contrary to the pollen records from the surface, the pollen assemblages from Sc{\u a}ri{\c s}oara Ice Cave are characterized by low frequencies and diversity of pollen of herbaceous plants (non-arboreal pollen, NAP) and coprophilous spores. However, there are fluctuating frequencies in these taxa, which appear to track changes in climate conditions (higher during the Medieval Warm Period and lower during the Little Ice Age), which suggest that land-use changes were likely modulated by the climate. High amounts of micro- and macro-charcoal particles between AD 1600 and 1850, when climate conditions were cool and wet, suggests that the charcoal was washed into the cave during times of extreme rainfall events, rather than associated with increased burning regime. A comparison with pollen records from the surface shows analogous forest development and fluctuations in the NAP, therefore supporting the hypothesis that the cave ice can be a valuable paleoecological archive.},

	abstract = {Radiocarbon dating is the most widely used dating technique in the world. Recent advances in Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) and sample preparation techniques have reduced the sample-size requirements by a factor of 1000 and decreased the measurement time from weeks to minutes. Today, it is estimated that more than 90 percent of all measurements made on accelerator mass spectrometers are for radiocarbon age dates. The production of 14C in the atmosphere varies through time due to changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field intensity and in its concentration, which is regulated by the carbon cycle. As a result of these two variables, a radiocarbon age is not equivalent to a calendar age. Four decades of joint research by the dendrochronology and radiocarbon communities have produced a radiocarbon calibration data set of remarkable precision and accuracy extending from the present to approximately 12,000 calendar years before present. This paper presents high precision paired 230Th/234U/238U and 14C age determinations on pristine coral samples that enable us to extend the radiocarbon calibration curve from 12,000 to 50,000 years before present. We developed a statistical model to properly estimate sample age conversion from radiocarbon years to calendar years, taking full account of combined errors in input ages and calibration uncertainties. Our radiocarbon calibration program is publicly accessible at: http://www.radiocarbon.LDEO.columbia.edu/ along with full documentation of the samples, data, and our statistical calibration model.},

@article{aniya1997glaciervariation,
	abstract = { The area variations of 48 outlet glaciers of the Southern Patagonia Icefield, South America, were elucidated for a period between 1944/45 and 1985/86, utilizing various remotely-sensed data. All but two of these glaciers are currently calving into a proglacial lake or a fiord. During the 41-yr period, most glaciers retreated, while a few glaciers remained almost stagnant and two glaciers had a net advance. The largest rate of area loss was 1.21 km2 yr−1 (or a distance of 484 m) at O'Higgins Glacier, which is by far the largest loss in Patagonia. On the other hand, P{\'\i}o XI Glacier, the largest glacier in South America, advanced at a rate of 1.45 km2 yr−1 (or a distance of 288 m) during the same period. Moreno Glacier oscillated frequently, with a net gain of 4.1 km2 in area in 39 yr; however, it is regarded to be currently in equilibrium. Some locational contrasts in the retreating rates can be recognized. For example, those on the northern half and on the east retreated at greater rates than those on the southern half and on the west, respectively. Possible causes for such variation patterns include temperature warming, although weak, in this century in the area south of latitude 46$\,^{\circ}$S. On top of such climatic forcing, glacier dynamics affected by the size of the glacier, surface gradient around the equilibrium line (EL), and calving status and channel geometry exerted influence, causing a wide variety of the changing rates. The volume of ice loss due to snout retreats during the 41-yr period is estimated to be on the order of 40 to 80 km3. The volume loss in the ablation area due to thinning is roughly estimated at about 100 to 300 km3 for the same period. },

	abstract = {A time-series composed of 156 ASTER derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and a radar-penetration-bias corrected version of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM is used to derive ice surface height and volume changes at the Southern Patagonian Ice Field (SPI) in southern South America. The observations, made between February 2000 and March 2012, indicate that the ice field is rapidly losing volume at many of the largest outlet glaciers, and in most cases thinning extends to the highest elevations of the ice field. Mass loss is occurring at a rate of −20.0 $\pm$ 1.2 Gt a−1, which, when summed with mass-loss at the adjacent Northern Patagonian Ice Field results in a combined rate of −24.4 $\pm$ 1.4 Gt a−1, equivalent to +0.067 $\pm$ 0.004 mm a−1of sea level rise. Our decade-long mass loss rates are substantially higher than those derived during the last three decades of the 20th century, but are in good agreement with recent GRACE observations. Our volume loss estimate is sensitive to constraints applied to the amount of thickening in the accumulation zone. New field measurements and a continued DEM time-series will be required to refine our estimates.},

	abstract = {
Glaciar San Rafael in the Northern Patagonia Icefield, with a length of 46 km and an ice area of 722 km2, is the lowest latitude tidewater outlet glacier in the world and one of the fastest and most productive glaciers in southern South America in terms of iceberg flux.
Spatio-temporal velocity fields in the region of the glacier front were determined from monoscopic terrestrial image sequences recorded by an inter-vallometer mode high-resolution digital camera over several days. In these image sequences, a large number of glacier surface points were tracked
by subpixel accuracy feature tracking techniques. Scaling and georeferencing of the trajectories obtained from image space tracking was performed using a multi-station GPS-supported photogrammetric network. The technique allows for tracking hundreds of glacier surface points at a measurement
accuracy in the order of one decimeter, for typical glacier movement rates, and an almost arbitrarily high temporal resolution. The results show velocities of up to 16 meters per day.

@article{Rosnell:2012aa,
	abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to develop and investigate methods for point cloud generation by image matching using aerial image data collected by quadrocopter type micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging systems. Automatic generation of high-quality, dense point clouds from digital images by image matching is a recent, cutting-edge step forward in digital photogrammetric technology. The major components of the system for point cloud generation are a UAV imaging system, an image data collection process using high image overlaps, and post-processing with image orientation and point cloud generation. Two post-processing approaches were developed: one of the methods is based on Bae Systems' SOCET SET classical commercial photogrammetric software and another is built using Microsoft({\textregistered})'s Photosynth{\texttrademark} service available in the Internet. Empirical testing was carried out in two test areas. Photosynth processing showed that it is possible to orient the images and generate point clouds fully automatically without any a priori orientation information or interactive work. The photogrammetric processing line provided dense and accurate point clouds that followed the theoretical principles of photogrammetry, but also some artifacts were detected. The point clouds from the Photosynth processing were sparser and noisier, which is to a large extent due to the fact that the method is not optimized for dense point cloud generation. Careful photogrammetric processing with self-calibration is required to achieve the highest accuracy. Our results demonstrate the high performance potential of the approach and that with rigorous processing it is possible to reach results that are consistent with theory. We also point out several further research topics. Based on theoretical and empirical results, we give recommendations for properties of imaging sensor, data collection and processing of UAV image data to ensure accurate point cloud generation.},

@article{WESTOBY2012300,
	abstract = {High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed `Structure-from-Motion' (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography.},

@article{JOUVET2018389,
	abstract = {The subglacial hydrology of tidewater glaciers is a key but poorly understood component of the complex ice-ocean system, which affects sea level rise. As it is extremely difficult to access the interior of a glacier, our knowledge relies mostly on the observation of input variables such as air temperature, and output variables such as the ice flow velocities reflecting the englacial water pressure, and the dynamics of plumes reflecting the discharge of meltwater into the ocean. In this study we use a cost-effective Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to monitor the daily movements of Bowdoin Glacier, north-west Greenland, and the dynamics of its main plume. Using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and feature-tracking techniques, we obtained 22 high-resolution ortho-images and 19 velocity fields at the calving front for 12 days in July 2016. Our results show a two-day-long speed-up event (up to 170%) -- caused by an increase in buoyant subglacial forces -- with a strong spatial variability revealing that enhanced acceleration is an indication of shallow bedrock. Further, we used the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method to analyze water flow from successive UAV images taken while flying over the main plume of the glacier. We found that PIV successfully captures the area of radially diverging flow of the plume, and provides information on spatial and time variability as no other remote sensing technique can. Most interestingly, the active part of the plume features pulsating water jets at the time scale of seconds, and is 1 to 5 times smaller than its visual footprint defined by the iceberg-free area. Combined with an ice flow model or a non-steady plume model, our approach has the potential to generate a novel set of input data to gather information about the depth of the bedrock, the discharge of meltwater, or the subglacial melting rate of tidewater glaciers.},

	abstract = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for photogrammetric surveying has recently gained enormous popularity. Images taken from UAVs are used for generating Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and orthorectified images. In the glaciological context, these can serve for quantifying ice volume change or glacier motion. This study focuses on the accuracy of UAV-derived DSMs. In particular, we analyze the influence of the number and disposition of Ground Control Points (GCPs) needed for georeferencing the derived products. A total of 1321 different DSMs were generated from eight surveys distributed on three glaciers in the Swiss Alps during winter, summer and autumn. The vertical and horizontal accuracy was assessed by cross-validation with thousands of validation points measured with a Global Positioning System. Our results show that the accuracy increases asymptotically with increasing number of GCPs until a certain density of GCPs is reached. We call this the optimal GCP density. The results indicate that DSMs built with this optimal GCP density have a vertical (horizontal) accuracy ranging between 0.10 and 0.25 m (0.03 and 0.09 m) across all datasets. In addition, the impact of the GCP distribution on the DSM accuracy was investigated. The local accuracy of a DSM decreases when increasing the distance to the closest GCP, typically at a rate of 0.09 m per 100-m distance. The impact of the glacier's surface texture (ice or snow) was also addressed. The results show that besides cases with a surface covered by fresh snow, the surface texture does not significantly influence the DSM accuracy.},

@article{dalziel1982early,
	abstract = {The building of the present Pacific Ocean margin cordillera in S S America, the islands of the N and S Scotia Ridges, and the Antarctic Peninsula was initiated in Middle - Late Jurassic time with the widespread extrusion of calc-alkaline, dominantly silicic, volcanic rocks throughout the Scotia arc region. These volcanic rocks everywhere rest with profound unconformity on a previously deformed and metamorphosed 'basement' complex. This paper is a review of our state of knowledge of this basement, based on the literature and on largely unpublished field observations by the author and his associates. The pre-Middle Jurassic history of the Scotia arc region has an important bearing on the reconstruction of Gondwanaland and on the early history of the SE Pacific Ocean basin, as well as on the evolution of the Scotia arc itself. The petrotectonic assemblage of the basement, considered in relation to the geology of the S Atlantic-Weddell Sea area as a whole, leaves little doubt that the complex represents portions of the fore-arc and main magmatic arc of a pre-Middle Jurassic subduction zone along the Pacific margin of Gondwanaland. Taken with the distribution of undoubtedly Precambrian crystalline rocks, the analysis also suggests that the Scotia arc may be located in an old reentrant in the margin of the supercontinent and thus calls to question the long-assumed original physical continuity of the Andes and the West Antarctic cordillera.-Author},

	abstract = {Abstract

The Denaro Complex, part of the Madre de Dios Terrane is composed of metamorphosed pillow basalts, metahyaloclastites, banded metalliferous and radiolarian metacherts, metapelites and redeposited calcareous metasandstones. The basaltic rocks show primary textures, minerals and structures. They are foliated especially in the vicinities of thrust faults, interpreted to have developed during the accretion of the terrane to the Gondwana margin. Composition of relic primary augite and chromite crystals plots into the MORB field of tectonic discriminant diagrams, as do the analyses of whole rock geochemistry, which indicates that these rocks are akin to volcanic rocks erupted along a constructive plate margin (N- and E-type MORBs), probably in a spreading axis-centered oceanic plateau or ridge. The metamorphic assemblages of pumpellyite--actinolite facies bear witness of metamorphism in a frontal accretionary wedge at elevated P and low T conditions, probably related to the Late Triassic--Early Jurassic Chonide event, which has been recognized elsewhere in the Patagonian Andes.},

@article{hughes2012precipitationweighted,
	abstract = {Summary
The relationship between δ2H and δ18O in precipitation at a site, known as the local meteoric water line (LMWL), is normally defined using an ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) which gives equal weighting to all data points regardless of the precipitation amount they represent. However, smaller precipitation amounts are more likely to have a lower D-excess due to re-evaporation of raindrops below the cloud-base or biases in the sampling method. In this paper we present an equation for a precipitation amount weighted least squares regression (PWLSR) that will correct these biases for use in groundwater and surface hydrology applications. New LMWL equations are presented for Australian sites in the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), where the PWLSR consistently produces a LMWL with a larger gradient than the OLSR. Perth and Alice Springs exhibit the largest change in slope. This is consistent with the higher frequency of small monthly precipitation amounts with low D-excess values occurring at these sites in summer for Perth and throughout the year for Alice Springs. The PWLSR method was also applied to 288 stations in the GNIP data base (N>36) and the difference between the slopes of the LMWLs (Δa=slopePWLSR--slopeOLSR) calculated for these stations. The mean change in slope, Δa was 0.12 with 56% of sites showing an increase in slope or positive Δa value and 44% having a decrease in slope or negative Δa. Sites with Mediterranean climates showed the greatest increase in slope. The magnitude of the change in slope followed some general trends showing a positive correlation with average δ2H and δ18O composition and rainfall variability, and negative correlation with period of record (N).},

The elementary theory of the processes that appear to explain the changes in the deuterium content of natural waters is developed. Quantitative expressions of the deuterium fractionation that can be expected to occur are presented for all phases of the hydrologic cycle from the evaporation of water from the oceans, its precipitation as rain and snow, and its travel back to the sea. Processes such as the freezing of water under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions, the evaporation of water from closed lakes and from lakes with an outlet, the formation of fog, frost, and dew are also discussed. The regional characteristics of the surface waters of North America are described and interpreted as reflecting the history of the water in the course of the hydrologic cycle.},

@article{ZONGXING2015262,
	abstract = {In order to firstly explore the stable isotope evolution of Shiyi glacier system in the central Qilian Mountains, a total of 167 samples have been collected from newly deposited snow, surface snow, snowpits, meltwater and glacier-fed river water from July 2012 to November 2013. The results indicated that only the newly deposited snow in 23 November 2013 showed a significant `altitude effect', whereas surface snow had a reverse `altitude effect' owing to evaporation and sublimation in summer 2012 and 2013. The δ18O and δD of surface snow sharply increased from July to August and then decreased in September 2012, decreased from April to May, increased until July, and then decreased again in August 2013. The homogenization of δ18O and δD was remarkable due to the post-depositional processes, and the isotopic exchange between the firn and the percolating water could cause more and more enrichment of heavy isotopes in the successive snowpits. The stable isotopes in meltwater mainly had been influenced by the ablation intensity, ablation duration and the newly deposited snow meltwater. For glacier-fed river water, the δ18O also had no obvious `altitude effect'. Based on the two-component separation model, 33% and 23% of the waters originated from meltwater in Hulugou catchment on 15 May at relatively higher and lower altitude regions, respectively. On 28 July 2013, meltwater was dominant at the altitude ranges of 4077--4438m in Hulugou catchment, accounting for almost 100% of the recharging sources, while it had contributed 44%, 42%, 32%, 20%, and 12% to runoff at the altitudes of 4038m, 3812m, 3600m, 3300m and 3000m.},

	abstract = {The number of days with a snow depth above a certain threshold is the key factor for winter tourism in an Alpine country like Switzerland. An investigation of 34 long-term stations between 200 and 1800 m asl (above sea level) going back for at least the last 60 years (1948--2007) shows an unprecedented series of low snow winters in the last 20 years. The signal is uniform despite high regional differences. A shift detection analysis revealed a significant step-like decrease in snow days at the end of the 1980's with no clear trend since then. This abrupt change resulted in a loss of 20\% to 60\% of the total snow days. The stepwise increase of the mean winter temperature at the end of the 1980's and its close correlation with the snow day anomalies corroborate the sensitivity of the mid-latitude winter to the climate change induced temperature increase.},

@article{FLEMING1998327,
	abstract = {The eustatic component of relative sea-level change provides a measure of the amount of ice transferred between the continents and oceans during glacial cycles. This has been quantified for the period since the Last Glacial Maximum by correcting observed sea-level change for the glacio-hydro-isostatic contributions using realistic ice distribution and earth models. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the eustatic sea level was 125$\pm$5 m lower than the present day, equivalent to a land-based ice volume of (4.6--4.9)×107 km3. Evidence for a non-uniform rise in eustatic sea level from the LGM to the end of the deglaciation is examined. The initial rate of rise from ca. 21 to 17 ka was relatively slow with an average rate of ca. 6 m ka−1, followed by an average rate of ca. 10 m ka−1 for the next 10 ka. Significant departures from these average rates may have occurred at the time of the Younger Dryas and possibly also around 14 ka. Most of the decay of the large ice sheets was completed by 7 ka, but 3--5 m of water has been added to the oceans since that time.},

@article{PATCHETT200429,
	abstract = {Sm--Nd and Lu--Hf isotopic data are presented for 19 chondritic meteorites: six carbonaceous chondrites, five L-chondrites, seven H-chondrites, and a single enstatite chondrite. The primary goal of the study is to better define the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) reference values for Hf isotopes. Except for one sample with lower Sm/Nd, the Sm--Nd data define a cluster around the accepted reference values for chondrites and terrestrial planets, giving a mean 147Sm/144Nd of 0.1960$\pm$0.0005, and a mean 143Nd/144Nd of 0.512631$\pm$0.000010 (uncertainties are two standard errors). It seems appropriate to retain the presently accepted Sm--Nd reference parameters, 147Sm/144Nd=0.1966 and 143Nd/144Nd=0.512638 (when fractionation-corrected to 146Nd/144Nd=0.7219).Lu--Hf isotopic data are not clustered, but spread along an approximate 4.5-Ga isochron trend, with a range of 176Lu/177Hf from 0.0301 to 0.0354. The data are similar to many of the samples of chondrites presented by Bizzarro et al. [Nature 421 (2003) 931], but lack the range to lower Lu/Hf shown by those authors. Our chondrite data define a regression line of 4.44$\pm$0.34 Ga when 1.867×10−11 year−1 is used for the decay constant of 176Lu [Science 293 (2001) 683; Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 219 (2004) 311--324]. Combining our data with the main population of analyses from Bizzarro et al. [Nature 421 (2003) 931] yields 4.51$\pm$0.24 Ga. Unless samples of eucrite meteorites and deviating replicates of chondrites with 176Lu/177Hf less than 0.030 are employed, no combination of the main population of chondrite Lu--Hf data yields a regression with sufficiently low error to constrain the decay constant of 176Lu. Sample heterogeneity seems to hinder the acquisition of reproducible Lu--Hf analyses from small, manually ground pieces of chondrites, and we suggest that analysis of powders prepared from large volumes of meteorite will be needed to adequately characterize the Lu--Hf isotope systematics of chondritic reservoirs and of BSE. Our results for carbonaceous chondrites show higher average 176Lu/177Hf and 176Hf/177Hf than ordinary chondrites, and the mean of carbonaceous chondrites also coincides with replicate analyses of a powder representing a large volume of meteorite, the Allende powder from the Smithsonian Institution. Use of the carbonaceous chondrite mean for BSE Lu--Hf characteristics results in a BSE Hf--Nd point that lies well within the array of terrestrial compositions, and leads to plausible initial εHf values for Precambrian rocks. An improved objective resolution of meteorite data and of meteoritic models for the Earth needs to occur before BSE can be established for Lu--Hf.},

	abstract = {Investigating the isotope systematics and behavior of selenium in subduction zones provides valuable insights into mechanisms that contribute to chalcophile and moderately volatile element distribution between terrestrial reservoirs. In this study, we present high-precision Se isotope and Se--Te elemental data on subduction zone lavas from the Mariana arc system. Our results indicate that Se--Te concentrations are unaffected by submarine degassing but are affected by magmatic differentiation. In contrast, Se isotopes of submarine lavas are unaffected by both magmatic differentiation and degassing and thus may preserve their magmatic source signature. Compared to the average Se isotope composition previously obtained for mantle-derived samples (δ82/76Se = 0.23 $\pm$ 0.12‰, 2 s.d., n = 5), suitable to represent the Mariana pre-subduction wedge, Mariana lavas show a larger overall range (δ82/76Se from 0.03 to −0.33‰, n = 21) with a clear tendency towards lighter Se isotope compositions. The variable Se isotope signatures within the Mariana suite can further be attributed to different slab-derived fluid and melt-like subduction components. This provides evidence for a significant role of subduction recycling of hydrothermal sulfide-containing altered oceanic crust and pelagic sediments with possible implications for the Se isotope evolution of the crust-mantle system throughout geological time.},

	abstract = {Geochemical and combined Sm-Nd vs. RbSr isotope data from the {\"O}tztal metabasite suite point to production of gabbros and basalts in an extensional regime in Late Cambrian times. The source of these magmas and cumulates had a chemical and isotopic composition similar to MORB. The time of intrusion is constrained by SmNd mineral isochrons (clinopyroxeneplagioclase) of relictic gabbro occurrences within the eclogite-amphibolite series in the time span between 530 and 521 Ma. Subsequently, the basic eclogite precursors suffered three metamorphic stages. The imprint of the ``Caledonian event'' is unclear. During the Hercynian cycle, the basic magmatic rocks were transformed into eclogites at surprisingly high P-T conditions of ∼27 kbar/730$\,^{\circ}$C. The time of this subduction event is given by mineral isochrons (garnet, clinopyroxene, zoisite, whole rock) as ∼ 370--340 Ma, with a most probable time span for the pressure peak between 360 and 350 Ma. During subsequent exhumation and pressure release the eclogites were partly transformed into amphibolites. Alpine overprint during a greenschist facies-grade metamorphism caused further and partly intense retrograde alterations in the metabasic suite.},

	abstract = {We present a 5.3-Myr stack (the ``LR04'' stack) of benthic δ18O records from 57 globally distributed sites aligned by an automated graphic correlation algorithm. This is the first benthic δ18O stack composed of more than three records to extend beyond 850 ka, and we use its improved signal quality to identify 24 new marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene. We also present a new LR04 age model for the Pliocene-Pleistocene derived from tuning the δ18O stack to a simple ice model based on 21 June insolation at 65$\,^{\circ}$N. Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model constraints to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning strategy, the LR04 benthic stack exhibits significant coherency with insolation in the obliquity band throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in the precession band for more than half of the record. The LR04 stack contains significantly more variance in benthic δ18O than previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result of higher-resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater percentage of records from the Atlantic. Finally, the relative phases of the stack's 41- and 23-kyr components suggest that the precession component of δ18O from 2.7--1.6 Ma is primarily a deep-water temperature signal and that the phase of δ18O precession response changed suddenly at 1.6 Ma.},

	abstract = {During the mid-Pleistocene transition the dominant 41 ka periodicity of glacial cycles transitioned to a quasi-100 ka periodicity for reasons not yet known. This study investigates the potential role of deep ocean hydrography by examining oxygen isotope ratios in benthic foraminifera. Oxygen isotope records from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins are separated into their ice volume and local temperature/hydrography components using a piece-wise linear transfer function and a temperature calibration. Although our method has certain limitations, the deep ocean hydrography reconstructions show that glacial deep ocean temperatures approached freezing point as the mid-Pleistocene transition progressed. Further analysis suggests that water mass reorganisation could have been responsible for these temperature changes, leading to such stable conditions in the deep ocean that some obliquity cycles were skipped until precessional forcing triggered deglaciation, creating the apparent quasi-100 ka pattern. This study supports previous work that suggests multiples of obliquity cycles dominate the quasi-100 ka glacial cycles with precession components driving deglaciations.},

	abstract = {A suite of divalent metal (Ca, Cd, Ba) carbonates was synthesized over the temperature range 10--40$\,^{\circ}$C by the classical method of slowly bubbling N2 through a bicarbonate solution. It was discovered that carbonates could be precipitated reproducibly in or out of isotopic equilibrium with the environmental solution by varying the concentrations of bicarbonate and cation. Precipitation rate had little or no influence on the isotopic composition of the product. Relatively high initial concentrations of up to 25 mM in both bicarbonate and cation were prepared by adding solid metal chlorides to solutions of NaHC03. On the basis of results of equilibrium experiments and a new determination of the acid fractionation factor, a new expression is proposed for the oxygen isotope fractionation between calcite and water at low temperatures: 10001nα(Calcite-H2O) = 18.03(103T−1) − 32.42 where α is the fractionation factor, and T is in kelvins. Combining new data for low-temperature precipitations and the high-temperature equilibrium fractionations published by O'Neil et al. (1969) results in a revised expression for the oxygen isotope fractionation between octavite (CdCO3) and water from 0$\,^{\circ}$ to 500$\,^{\circ}$C: 10001nα(CdC0P3H2O) = 2.76(106T−2) − 3.96 The ability to produce nonequilibrium carbonates allowed assessment to be made, for the first time, of the temperature dependence of nonequilibrium stable isotope fractionations in mineral systems. The temperature coefficients of a(carbonate-water) for nonequilibrium divalent metal carbonates are greater than those for equilibrium carbonates, a finding that may bear on the interpretation of analyses of biogenic carbonates forming out of isotopic equilibrium in nature. New determinations of acid fractionation factors (10001nα) at 25$\,^{\circ}$C for calcite (10.44 − 0.10), aragonite (11.01 $\pm$ 0.01), and witherite (10.57 − 0.16) are mildly to strongly different from those published by Sharma and Clayton (1965) and point to a control on this fractionation by some physical property of the mineral. Reproducible values for octavite (CdC03) varied from 11.18 to 13.60 depending on the conditions of preparation of the carbonate. These new values need to be considered in determinations of absolute 18801660 ratios of international reference standards and in relating analyses of carbonates to those of waters, silicates, and oxides.},

@article{LECUYER2013217,
	abstract = {There are significant ambiguities concerning the accuracy of oxygen isotope fractionation equations commonly used to retrieve aquatic paleotemperatures from the δ18O value of phosphatic skeletal remains. This is mainly due to the lack of a certified phosphate standard value, discrepancies in measured standard values between laboratories, and differences in methodologies used to constrain phosphate--water fractionation. Depending on the equation used, differences in calculated isotopic water temperatures may range from 4 to 8$\,^{\circ}$C, these sizable uncertainties significantly reducing the effectiveness of the phosphate 18O/16O ratio as a proxy for water temperature. To address this problem, several phosphate--water fractionation equations from the literature have been tested against the well constrained oxygen isotope fractionation between calcium carbonate and water. Temperatures derived from several pairs of present-day (brachiopods) and fossil (ammonites, brachiopods, belemnite) co-existing carbonate-secreting invertebrates and phosphate-secreting vertebrates (fish) are compared to elucidate the most accurate phosphate-water fractionation equation. These temperatures were obtained by considering using a δ18O value close to 21.7‰ (VSMOW) for the reference phosphorite SRM 120c. The temperature difference (ΔT) calculated from various carbonate--water and phosphate--water oxygen isotope fractionation equations consistently show that the proposed phosphate--water temperature scale established using both modern lingulids and sharks, T($\,^{\circ}$C)=117.4($\pm$9.5)−4.50($\pm$0.43)∗(δ18OPO4−δ18OH2O), consistently yields temperatures from bioapatites equivalent to those from co-existing carbonates. Compared to other published phosphate-water fractionation equations, this new equation provides the most reliable estimates of aquatic paleotemperatures for bioapatites.},

	abstract = {Aragonite was precipitated in the laboratory at 0, 5, 10, 25, and 40$\,^{\circ}$C to determine the temperature dependence of the equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation between aragonite and water. Forced CO2 degassing, passive CO2 degassing, and constant addition methods were employed to precipitate aragonite from supersaturated solutions, but the resulting aragonite--water oxygen isotope fractionation was independent of the precipitation method. In addition, under the experimental conditions of this study, the effect of precipitation rate on the oxygen isotope fractionation between aragonite and water was almost within the analytical error of $\pm$∼0.13‰ and thus insignificant. Because the presence of Mg2+ ions is required to nucleate and precipitate aragonite from Na--Ca--Cl--HCO3 solutions under these experimental conditions, the influence of the total Mg2+ concentration (up to ∼0.9 molal) on the aragonite--water oxygen isotope fractionation was examined at 25$\,^{\circ}$C. No significant Mg2+ ion effect, or oxygen isotope salt effect, was detected up to 100mmolal total Mg2+ but a noticeable isotope salt effect was observed at ∼0.9 molal total Mg2+. On the basis of results of the laboratory synthesis experiments, a new expression for the aragonite--water fractionation is proposed over the temperature range of 0--40$\,^{\circ}$C:1000lnαaragonite-water=17.88$\pm$0.13(103/T)-31.14$\pm$0.46where αaragonite--water is the fractionation factor between aragonite and water, and T is in kelvins. Given the analytical and statistical errors associated with this and previous determinations, the new relation reveals that many biogenic aragonites are precipitated at and or very near oxygen isotope equilibrium with their ambient water. When the new aragonite--water expression is combined with the calcite--water calibration published by Kim and O 'Neil [Kim S. -T., and O'Neil J. R. (1997) Equilibrium and nonequilibrium oxygen isotope effects in synthetic carbonates. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta61, 3461--3475], a positive aragonite--calcite fractionation (∼0.8‰ at 25$\,^{\circ}$C) is obtained over the temperature range investigated.},

Here we present new dissolution rates of anorthite and augite which indicate that silicate weathering in organic-rich solutions is not directly affected by soil CO2 but is very sensitive to temperature. Apparently CO2 accelerates silicate weathering indirectly by fertilizing organic activity and the production of corrosive organic acids. The weathering dependencies highlight the ability of silicate weathering to act as a global thermostat and damp out climate change, when used as input in steady-state carbon cycle and climate models.},

This finding supports recent suggestions that hydrolytic weathering of silicate minerals may consume carbonic acid and thereby remove atmospheric carbon dioxide more rapidly with increasing temperature than previously thought. This result provides a stronger negative feedback on long-term greenhouse warming than has been assumed in most models of global carbon cycling. The present estimate was determined from the ratio of feldspar weathering rates (determined by geochemical mass balance) in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, United States. Temperature (a function of elevation) is the only factor that differs between the two catchments; parent rock type, aspect, hillslope hydrology, and vegetation type and successional stage are the same in both.}},

@article{SAURO201351,
	abstract = {The Piani Eterni karst system is one of the longest and deepest caves of Italy situated in the southern sector of the Dolomiti mountain range. The area where the cave was formed displays peculiar structural settings confined in a tectonic transpressive corridor between two regional thrusts (Belluno and Valsugana). During Miocene uplift of the range the inheritance of Mesozoic structures led to the formation of a deep and wide upward-branching flower (or palm tree) structure cutting the carbonate sequence and exposing the surrounding surface to karst processes after erosion. The relative lowering of the hydrologic base level, due both to the uplift of the area and then to the carving of deep glacial valleys in the Quaternary, allowed the formation of paleo-phreatic conduits at subsequently deeper levels, interconnected by vadose shafts and canyons. This work gives a detailed tectonic interpretation of the transpressive structure and picks out the tectonic features most favorable to the karst development. A detailed statistical analysis of the distribution and orientation of the karst conduits was performed using 31km of 3D surveys showing that the development of the cave was strictly guided by a few favorable surfaces of stratigraphic and tectonic origin. These features are known in the literature as inception horizons and tectonic inception features, respectively. Cave levels are usually related to lithologic favorable conditions associated with standings of the paleo-water table. Here we suggest that some tectonic surface geometries could have led to the opening of voids in the active tectonic phase leading to the formation of the original proto-conduit network. Different types of tectonic inception features identified in the cave were described in terms of geometry and kinematics. Tensional fractures, as well as fault plane undulations and flexural slip surfaces between beds, are described as the most favorable tectonic surfaces for the development of the conduits. Finally, we discuss why transpressional settings and related flower structures in soluble rocks can enhance the karst process allowing the formation of huge and deep karst systems.},

More than 700 m of platform Lofer cycles at the Steinernes Meer are analyzed, and the transition from those peritidal Lofer cycles through cyclic and noncyclic sediments of the adjacent Hochkoenig reef complex to the Hochkoenig reef slope and both Koessen and Hallstatt basin successions is outlined. This paper stresses the notion of a dynamic balance between random deposition and reworking within an unpredictable and complex sedimentary system, rather than orderly sedimentation in response to orbital forcing. The role of random vertical tectonic downdropping is considered here but has rarely been fully considered in previous studies of cyclic carbonates. It may not be realistic to assume that subsidence over time can be accurately represented by a smooth trace in areas where subsidence is partly or wholly fault controlled. Throughout this paper, the term periodic is used to indicate events with a specific temporal recurrence interval. Aperiodic is used to describe temporally recurrent events that lack a controlled recurrence interval. Aperiodic events described in this paper could also be loosely considered random.},

@article{JOERIN2008337,
	abstract = {This study investigates the subglacial sedimentary archive at Tschierva Glacier, Eastern Swiss Alps. Subfossil wood remains found at the retreating glacier tongue indicate that their emergence results from recent transport from an upvalley basin. A confluence-basin-like structure was found to exist by georadar measurements underneath the present glacier. In combination with high resolution age determinations based on dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating it is implied that a retreated Tschierva Glacier allowed vegetation growth and sediment accumulation in that basin. Three periods of glacier recession were detected, which occurred around 9200calyrBP, from 7450 to 6650calyrBP and from 6200 to 5650calyrBP. These periods are called Holocene optimum events (HOE). Accordingly, an equilibrium line rise >220m compared to the reference period from 1960 to 1985 was inferred from digital elevation models of former glacier extents. Since glacier mass balance depends on summer (June--July--August) temperature and precipitation, an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) rise of 220m implies a summer temperature increase of about 1.8$\,^{\circ}$C assuming unchanged precipitation during the dated HOE. Alternative calculations point to probable temperature increase in a broad interval between +1.0$\,^{\circ}$C taking into account a precipitation change of −250mm/a to +2.5$\,^{\circ}$C with +250mm/a precipitation change, supporting earlier paleotemperature estimates. It is proposed that higher mean summer insolation caused a stronger seasonality during the mid-Holocene as compared to late Holocene conditions.},

	abstract = {Over the past ∼30 years numerous basal ice facies have been identified, named and classified. However, the resulting facies descriptions and names are inconsistent and no single scheme encompasses all of the different ice types that exist at different ice masses. In this paper, we review and critique existing basal ice facies names, descriptions and classification schemes, and propose a new, non-genetic approach that has the capacity to name and describe all basal ice types. We define six fundamental basal cryofacies and a further 12 composite cryofacies which can all be defined on the basis of a cursory evaluation of debris disposition and concentration. More detailed cryofacies description is based on characterizing three sets of ice properties that can also be estimated visually in the field: (a) the thickness of the basal ice facies and its constituent sub-layers, (b) the concentration and texture of debris included within any or all of those layers, and (c) the concentration and size of bubbles included within any or all of those layers. We also propose a shorthand method for the presentation of this descriptive information. Here, codes for the layer thicknesses are presented as standard text, and codes for the included debris characteristics and included bubble characteristics are presented as superscripts and subscripts respectively. Sub-layers are characterized similarly, but within a nested sequence of brackets. We evaluate the effectiveness of these two schemes by using them to rename and reclassify several existing basal ice facies. Results indicate that the schemes are robust and that they provide a coherent, non-genetic framework for the effective naming and description of basal cryofacies.},

@article{ivyochs2009glaciervariations,
	abstract = {In the Alps, climatic conditions reflected in glacier and rock glacier activity in the earliest Holocene show a strong affinity to conditions in the latest Pleistocene (Younger Dryas). Glacier advances in the Alps related to Younger Dryas cooling led to the deposition of Egesen stadial moraines. Egesen stadial moraines can be divided into three or in some cases even more phases (sub-stadials). Moraines of the earliest and most extended advance, the Egesen maximum, stabilized at 12.2$\pm$1.0ka based on 10Be exposure dating at the Sch{\"o}nferwall (Tyrol, Austria) and the Julier Pass-outer moraine (Switzerland). Final stabilization of moraines at the end of the Egesen stadial was at 11.3$\pm$0.9ka as shown by 10Be data from four sites across the Alps. From west to east the sites are Piano del Praiet (northwestern Italy), Grosser Aletschgletscher (central Switzerland), Julier Pass-inner moraine (eastern Switzerland), and Val Viola (northeastern Italy). There is excellent agreement of the 10Be ages from the four sites. In the earliest Holocene, glaciers in the northernmost mountain ranges advanced at around 10.8$\pm$1.1ka as shown by 10Be data from the Kartell site (northern Tyrol, Austria). In more sheltered, drier regions rock glacier activity dominated as shown, for example, at Julier Pass and Larstig valley (Tyrol, Austria). New 10Be dates presented here for two rock glaciers in Larstig valley indicate final stabilization no later than 10.5$\pm$0.8ka. Based on this data, we conclude the earliest Holocene (between 11.6 and about 10.5ka) was still strongly affected by the cold climatic conditions of the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal oscillation, with the intervening warming phase having had the effect of rapid downwasting of Egesen glaciers. At or slightly before 10.5ka rapid shrinkage of glaciers to a size smaller than their late 20th century size reflects markedly warmer and possibly also drier climate. Between about 10.5ka and 3.3ka conditions in the Alps were not conducive to significant glacier expansion except possibly during rare brief intervals. Past tree-line data from Kaunertal (Tyrol, Austria) in concert with radiocarbon and dendrochronologically dated wood fragments found recently in the glacier forefields in both the Swiss and Austrian Alps points to long periods during the Holocene when glaciers were smaller than they were during the late 20th century. Equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) were about 200m higher than they are today and about 300m higher in comparison to Little Ice Age (LIA) ELAs. The Larstig rock glacier site we dated with 10Be is the type area for a postulated mid-Holocene cold period called the Larstig oscillation (presumed age about 7.0ka). Our data point to final stabilization of those rock glaciers in the earliest Holocene and not in the middle Holocene. The combined data indicate there was no time window in the middle Holocene long enough for rock glaciers of the size and at the elevation of the Larstig site to have formed. During the short infrequent cold oscillations between 10.5 and 3.3ka small glaciers (less than several km2) may have advanced to close to their LIA dimensions. Overall, the cold periods were just too short for large glaciers to advance. After 3.3ka, climate conditions became generally colder and warm periods were brief and less frequent. Large glaciers (for example Grosser Aletschgletscher) advanced markedly at 3.0--2.6ka, around 600 AD and during the LIA. Glaciers in the Alps attained their LIA maximum extents in the 14th, 17th, and 19th centuries, with most reaching their greatest LIA extent in the final 1850/1860 AD advance.},

@article{Corbella2004,
	abstract = {A large number of Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) deposits are located within dissolution zones in carbonate host rocks. Some genetic models propose the existence of cavities generated by an earlier event such as a shallow karstification, that were subsequently filled with hydrothermal minerals. Alternative models propose carbonate dissolution caused by the simultaneous precipitation of sulfides. These models fail to explain either the deep geological setting of the cavities, or the observational features which suggest that the dissolution of carbonates and the precipitation of minerals filling the cavities are not strictly coeval. We present a genetic model inspired by the textural characteristics of MVT deposits that accounts for both the dissolution of carbonate and precipitation of sulfides and later carbonates in variable volumes. The model is based on the mixing of two hydrothermal fluids with a different chemistry. Depending on the proportion of the end members, the mixture dissolves and precipitates carbonates even though the two mixing solutions are both independently saturated in carbonates. We perform reactive transport simulations of mixing of a regional groundwater and brine ascending through a fracture, both saturated in calcite, but with different overall chemistries (Ca and carbonate concentrations, pH, etc). As a result of the intrinsic effects of chemical mixing, a carbonate dissolution zone, which is enhanced by acid brines, appears above the fracture, and another zone of calcite precipitation builds up between the cavity and the surrounding rock. Sulfide forms near the fracture and occupies a volume smaller than the cavity. A decline of the fluid flux in the fracture would cause the precipitation of calcite within the previously formed cavities. Therefore, dissolution of carbonate host rock, sulfide precipitation within the forming cavity, and later filling by carbonates may be part of the same overall process of mixing of fluids in the carbonate host rock.},

@article{Sibley87,
	abstract = {Dolomite rock textures can be classified according to crystal size distribution and crystal boundary shape. The classification scheme presented here is largely descriptive but carries genetic implications because size distribution is controlled by both nucleation and growth kinetics, and crystal boundary shape is controlled by growth kinetics. Size distributions are classified as unimodal or polymodal. Crystal boundary shapes are classified as planar or nonplanar. If the evidence permits, a complete classification includes a description of recognizable allochems, matrix, and void filling. Allochems and preexisting cements may be unreplaced, partially replaced, replaced mimically, or replaced nonmimically. Allochems may be dissolved, leaving molds. Matrix can be unreplace, partially replaced, or replaced by a unimodal or polymodal size dolomite. Unimodal size distributions generally indicated a single nucleation event on a unimodal substrate. Polymodal sizes can be formed by multiple nucleation events on a unimodal or polymodal substrate or differential nucleation on an originally polymodal substrate. Planar crystal boundaries develop when crystals undergo faceted growth, and nonplanar boundaries develop when crystals undergo nonfaceted growth. Nonplanar boundaries are characteristic of growth at elevated temperature (\&gt; 50 degrees C) and/or high supersaturation. Both planar and nonplanar dolomite can form as a cement, replacement of CaCO 3 , or neomorphism of a precursor dolomite.},

Features in the overall pattern include the great size, regional anastomosis, and low sinuosity of the channels. Erosional features are streamlined hills, longitudinal grooves, inner channel cataracts, scour upstream of flow obstacles, and perhaps marginal cataracts and butte and basin topography. Depositional features are bar complexes in expanding reaches and perhaps pendant bars and alcove bars. Scabland erosion takes place in exceedingly deep, swift floodwater acting on closely jointed bedrock as a hydrodynamic consequence of secondary flow phenomena, including various forms of macroturbulent votices and flow separations. If the analogy to the Channeled Scabland is correct, floods involving water discharges of millions of cubic meters per second and peak flow velocities of tens of meters per second, but perhaps lasting no more than a few days, have occurred on Mars.},

	abstract = {Ares Vallis is one of the greatest outflow channels of Mars. Using high-resolution images of recent missions to Mars (MGS, 2001 Odyssey, and Mars Express), we investigated Ares Vallis and its valley arms, taking advantage of 3-dimensional analysis performed using the high-resolution stereo capability of the Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). In our view, Ares Vallis is characterized by catastrophic flood landscapes partially superimposed by ice-related morphologies. Catastrophic flood landforms include erosional terraces, grooved terrains, streamlined uplands, giant bars, pendant bars, and cataract-like features. Ice-related morphologies include probable kame features, thermokarstic depressions, and patterned grounds. Our investigations outline that throughout the Hesperian age, Ares Vallis and its valley arms had been sculpted by several, time-scattered, catastrophic floods, originating from Iani, Hydaspis and Aram Chaos. Geomorphological evidence suggests that catastrophic floods were ice-covered, and that climatic conditions of Mars at this time were similar to those of the present day. At the end of each catastrophic flood, ice masses grounded, forming a thick stagnant dead-ice body. Each catastrophic flood was followed by a relatively brief period of warmer-wetter climatic conditions, originated as a consequence of catastrophic flooding. During such periods thermokarstic depressions originated, liquid water formed meandering channels, and ice-contact deposits were emplaced by ice-walled streams. Finally, the climate turned into cold-dry conditions similar to the present-day ones, and ice masses sublimated.},

@article{CARR2010185,
	abstract = {Mars accumulated and differentiated into crust, mantle and core within a few tens of millions of years of Solar System formation. Formation of Hellas, which has been adopted as the base of the Noachian period, is estimated to have occurred around 4.1 to 3.8 Gyr ago, depending on whether or not the planet experienced a late cataclysm. Little is known of the pre-Noachian period except that it was characterized by a magnetic field, subject to numerous large basin-forming impacts, probably including one that formed the global dichotomy. The Noachian period, which ended around 3.7 Gyr ago, was characterized by high rates of cratering, erosion, and valley formation. Most of Tharsis formed and surface conditions were at least episodically such as to cause widespread production of hydrous weathering products such as phyllosilicates. Extensive sulfate deposits accumulated late in the era. Average erosion rates, though high compared with later epochs, fell short of the lowest average terrestrial rates. The record suggests that warm, wet conditions necessary for fluvial activity were met only occasionally, such as might occur if caused by large impacts or volcanic eruptions. At the end of the Noachian, rates of impact, valley formation, weathering, and erosion all dropped precipitously but volcanism continued at a relatively high average rate throughout the Hesperian, resulting in the resurfacing of at least 30% of the planet. Large water floods formed episodically, possibly leaving behind large bodies of water. The canyons formed. The observations suggest the change at the end of the Noachian suppressed most aqueous activity at the surface other than large floods, and resulted in growth of a thick cryosphere. However, presence of discrete sulfate rich deposits, sulfate concentrations in soils, and occasional presence of Hesperian valley networks indicates that water activity did not decline to zero. After the end of the Hesperian around 3 Gyr ago the pace of geologic activity slowed further. The average rate of volcanism during the Amazonian was approximately a factor of ten lower than in the Hesperian and activity was confined largely to Tharsis and Elysium. The main era of water flooding was over, although small floods occurred episodically until geologically recent times. Canyon development was largely restricted to formation of large landslides. Erosion and weathering rates remained extremely low. The most distinctive characteristic of the Amazonian is formation of features that have been attributed to the presence, accumulation, and movement of ice. Included are the polar layered deposits, glacial deposits on volcanoes, ice-rich veneers at high latitudes, and a variety of landforms in the 30--55$\,^{\circ}$ latitude belts, including lobate debris aprons, lineated valley fill and concentric crater fill. Most of the gullies on steep slopes also formed late in this era. The rate of formation of the ice-related features and the gullies probably varied as changes in obliquity affected the ice stability relations.},

@article{DARLING2004743,
	abstract = {In the context of this paper, stable isotopic proxies are those preserving directly, or via known or calculable fractionation factors, a record of 18O/16O and/or 2H/1H in the water which contributed to their growth. Suitable proxies include amongst others tree-ring cellulose, bone phosphate, lake sediment minerals and speleothem fluid inclusions. A principal aim of studying isotopic proxies is to gain more information about past climates through a knowledge of how rainfall isotope compositions have changed over time. However, converting back from proxy to rainfall is not necessarily straightforward, because however well the isotopic fractionation due to proxy growth or formation is understood, a variety of modifying processes may have intervened between this and the actual rainfall events. Three main reservoirs of environmental water may contribute to the isotopic compositions of terrestrial proxy indicators: surface waters, soil moisture, and groundwater. Each of these can in principle be isotopically modified compared to rainfall in the locality. This review examines these effects and how they may change under different European climate types at the present day. It is concluded that while groundwater isotopic compositions typically represent closely the bulk composition of rainfall under a variety of climatic regimes, soil and particularly lake waters require detailed study if their isotope systematics are to be adequately understood. The review also finds that to a large extent ``the present is the key to the past'' in terms of recharge processes during the late Pleistocene, though glaciation may have had profound isotopic consequences in certain areas, while a more general aridity led to the apparent absence of recharge in most areas for much of the late Devensian.},

@article{WANNER20081791,
	abstract = {The last 6000years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial--interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD ∼1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH).},

@article{Battarbee2002,
	abstract = {This paper compares the palaeolimnological evidence for climate change over the last 200 years with instrumental climate data for the same period at seven European remote mountain lakes. The sites are {\O}vre Ne{\aa}dalsvatn (Norway), Saanaj{\"a}rvi (Finland), Gossenk{\"o}llesee (Austria), Hagelseewli (Switzerland), Jezero v Ledvici (Slovenia), Estany Red{\'o} (Spain, Pyrenees), and Ni{\v{z}}n{\'e} Terianske Pleso (Slovakia). We used multiple regression analysis to transfer homogenised lowland air temperature records to each of the sites, and these reconstructions were validated using data from on-site automatic weather stations. These data showed that mean annual temperature has varied over the last 200 years at each site by between 1 and 2 {\textdegree}C, typical of the high frequency variability found throughout the Holocene, and appropriate, therefore, to test the sensitivity of the various proxy methods used. Sediment cores from each site were radiometrically dated using 210Pb, 137Cs and 241Am and analysed for loss-on-ignition, C, N, S, pigments, diatoms, chrysophytes, Cladocera and chironomids. Comparisons between the proxy data and the instrumental data were based on linear regression analysis with the proxy data treated as response variables and the instrumental data (after smoothing using LOESS regressions) as predictor variables. The results showed few clear or consistent patterns with generally low or very low r2 values. Highest values were found when the data were compared after smoothing using a broad span, indicating that some of the proxy data were capturing climate variability but only at a relatively coarse time resolution. Probable reasons for the weak performance of the methods used include inaccurate dating, especially for earlier time periods, the influence of confounding forcing factors at some sites e.g., air pollution, earthquakes, and the insensitivity of some methods to low amplitude climate forcing. Nevertheless, there were trends in some proxy records at a number of sites that had a relatively unambiguous correspondence with the instrumental climate records. These included organic matter and associated variables (C and N) and planktonic diatom assemblages at the majority of sites and chrysophytes and chironomids at a few sites. Overall for longer term studies of the Holocene, these results indicate the need to be cautious in the interpretation of proxy records, the importance of proxy method validation, the continuing need to use reinforcing multi-proxy approaches, and the need for careful site and method selection.},

	abstract = {Fossil chironomids (non-biting midges) from varved Lake Silvaplana, Switzerland, were used to reconstruct climate (mean July air temperatures) during the last millennium. At the beginning of the record, corresponding to the last part of the ``Medieval Climate Anomaly'' (MCA) (here the period between ca 1032 and 1262 AD), the chironomid-inferred mean July air temperatures were 1$\,^{\circ}$C warmer (p<0.01) than the climate reference period (1961--1990). The ``Little Ice Age'' seems to have been separated into three phases: significantly colder (−1.1$\,^{\circ}$C in average, p<0.001) temperatures were inferred between ca 1262 and 1481 AD, between ca 1514 and 1718 AD (−1.2$\,^{\circ}$C in average, p<0.001) and between ca 1734 and 1782 AD (−0.6$\,^{\circ}$C in average, p<0.1). Although the average temperature changes inferred by chironomids were within the error of prediction (1.5$\,^{\circ}$C) of the chironomid-temperature inference model used for reconstruction, the pattern of temperature changes corresponds well with records of the past millennium in Switzerland, in Europe and in the Northern Hemisphere. The average inferred July temperatures between ca 1900 and 2001 AD were significantly warmer (p<0.05) than the climate reference period (1961--1990) by 1$\,^{\circ}$C which is in agreement with the instrumental data. The inferred July temperatures were in the same range as the inferred temperatures during the last part of the MCA suggesting that during the 20th century, at Lake Silvaplana, the chironomid-inferred temperatures do not exceed the natural climate variability of the past millennium.},

@article{PARNELL20081872,
	abstract = {The dating of depths in two or more cores is frequently followed by a study of the synchroneity or otherwise of events reflected in the cores. The difficulties most frequently encountered are: (a) determining precisely the depths associated with the events; and (b) determining the ages associated with the depths. There has been much progress in recent years in developing tools for the study of uncertainties in establishing chronologies. This has not yet been matched by similar progress in modelling event/depth relationships. This paper proposes a simple and flexible approach, showing how uncertain events can be married to uncertain chronologies. Difficulties in studying event/depth/age relationships typically involve a confounding of two different problems. First, what exactly do we mean by an `event' -- a point in history, a single depth in the core corresponding to a single time, or a depth/time range? Sometimes `event' is in fact a shorthand for a space-time process. Do the data reflect more than one type of event/process? This can reflect vagueness in definition. Second, what are the sources and implications of the uncertainties? Here we illustrate the issues involved by examination of several features seen in north European Holocene pollen records. The Alnus rise is regarded as a diachronous early Holocene event; in contrast the Ulmus decline is widely seen as a near synchronous event in the mid-Holocene. The third feature we examine is the interval between the Ulmus decline and the first occurrence of Cerealia-type pollen. The evidence for these events lies in cores of lake sediment from which are determined: (a) the proportions of pollen at many depths; and (b) radiocarbon age estimates from, usually, fewer depths. For this illustration we focus on six sites. We draw attention to a new and flexible method (implemented in the free R software package Bchron; [Haslett, J., Parnell, A., 2008. A simple monotone process with application to radiocarbon dated depth chronologies. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C 57 (4), 399--418]) for the establishment of the uncertainties surrounding the dating of samples in such cores. We illustrate its flexibility by assessing the synchroneity of past events.},

An alternative method based on importance sampling through calibrated dates is proposed. Dedicated R code is presented which works with calibrated radiocarbon as well as other dates, and provides a simple, systematic, transparent, documented and customizable alternative. The code automatically produces age--depth models, enabling exploration of the impacts of different assumptions (e.g., model type, hiatuses, age offsets, outliers, and extrapolation).},

	abstract = {The sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were determined in subalpine lacustrine high-carbonate (>50%) sediments (Lake Bled, Slovenia) using a combination of chemical and carbon stable isotope analyses together with incubation experiments. The carbon dynamics in the sediment was simulated by a numerical model that accounts for all basic processes controlling the concentration and isotopic composition of DIC. The remineralized carbon (DIC plus CH4) has mean δ13C value of −28.4‰. The dominant carbon isotope effect expressed during early diagenesis of this organic matter is associated with methanogenesis. Methane produced at this site has a measured value of −69‰, while DIC is enriched in 13C (−12.6‰) because of the preferential synthesis of 12CH4. In sediment pore water, the isotopic composition of DIC reflects the combination from degradation of organic carbon using various electron acceptors and methanogenesis. It was found that the major contribution (38--78%) of DIC is derived from methanogenesis. The highest contribution of CaCO3 dissolution was observed in the spring (12%), characterized by lower bottom water temperatures and slower degradation of sedimentary organic matter.},

@article{EICHLER20111027,
	abstract = {Forest fires play a key role in the global carbon cycle and thus, can affect regional and global climate. Although fires in extended areas of Russian boreal forests have a considerable influence on atmospheric greenhouse gas and soot concentrations, estimates of their impact on climate are hampered by a lack of data on the history of forest fires. Especially regions with strong continental climate are of high importance due to an intensified development of wildfires. In this study we reconstruct the fire history of Southern Siberia during the past 750 years using ice-core based nitrate, potassium, and charcoal concentration records from Belukha glacier in the continental Siberian Altai. A period of exceptionally high forest-fire activity was observed between AD 1600 and 1680, following an extremely dry period AD 1540--1600. Ice-core pollen data suggest distinct forest diebacks and the expansion of steppe in response to dry climatic conditions. Coherence with a paleoenvironmental record from the 200 km distant Siberian lake Teletskoye shows that the vegetational shift AD 1540--1680, the increase in fire activity AD 1600--1680, and the subsequent recovery of forests AD 1700 were of regional significance. Dead biomass accumulation in response to drought and high temperatures around AD 1600 probably triggered maximum forest-fire activity AD 1600--1680. The extreme dry period in the 16th century was also observed at other sites in Central Asia and is possibly associated with a persistent positive mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). No significant increase in biomass burning occurred in the Altai region during the last 300 years, despite strongly increasing temperatures and human activities. Our results imply that precipitation changes controlled fire-regime and vegetation shifts in the Altai region during the past 750 years. We conclude that high sensitivity of ecosystems to occasional decadal-scale drought events may trigger unprecedented environmental reorganizations under global-warming conditions.},

@article{BROCKLEHURST200835,
	abstract = {The development of relief in glaciated landscapes plays a crucial role in hypotheses relating climate change and tectonic processes. In particular, glaciers can only be responsible for peak uplift if they are capable of generating significant relief in formerly nonglaciated landscapes. Previous work has suggested that relief in glaciated landscapes should scale with the thickness of the ice. Here we summarise a field-based test of this hypothesis in two mountain ranges in the western United States, the Sierra Nevada, California, and the Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado. These areas exhibit a range of degrees of glacial occupation during the Quaternary, including some drainage basins essentially unoccupied by ice, allowing a detailed exploration of how relief in different parts of a drainage basin evolves in response to glacial modification. We mapped last glacial maximum (LGM) trimlines to estimate the ice thickness at the equilibrium line altitude during the LGM, and determined several metrics of relief for drainage basins across the full spectrum of LGM ice extents. Comparison between measures of relief and ice thickness estimates indicates that relief production in glaciated mountain belts scales with ice thickness and consequently also drainage area. We extended our study to the Bitterroot Range in Idaho/Montana, and the Teton Range in Wyoming, for a more comprehensive understanding of sub-ridgeline relief, or `missing mass'. This measure of mean relief is surprisingly little affected by either the degree of glacial modification or the total material removed by glaciers, but appears to be influenced by the more active tectonics of the Teton Range. While the effects of glacial modification on the landscape are clear (valley widening, hanging valley formation), the overall change in the relief structure of the mountain ranges studied here is surprisingly modest.},

	abstract = {Glacial erosion is approximated as a simple linear function of basal sliding, but is actually dependent on a myriad of spatially and temporally varying boundary conditions. Glacial erosion is more proficient than fluvial erosion, but both are limited by the local rate of tectonic rock uplift. The unique characteristics of glacial topography can be linked to mechanics of the erosion process and local conditions (e.g., selective linear erosion under polythermal ice conditions), as demonstrated in surface process models. Some kinematic aspects of glacial erosion are exclusive, including a focusing of erosion at equilibrium-line altitude, aggressive headwall retreat, and relatively rapid topographic adjustment to climate change. As a result of these characteristics, orogenic systems behave differently when dominated by glaciers. Under the right conditions, rapid rock uplift and efficient glacial erosion limit topography, induce steady-state orogenic flux, and focus crustal strain, thus imparting geodynamic significance to glacial climate. This hypothesis of a `glacial buzzsaw' has been verified both topographically and exhumationally in a variety of settings worldwide, as well as in numerical models of orogenic evolution. Unraveling exceptions to this, including `teflon peaks' and glacial thresholds, is key to improving understanding of the tectonic geomorphology of glaciated terrain.},

	abstract = {We present a study on the impact of litho-structural setting and neotectonic activity on meso- and macro-scale relief production in Alpine areas. The topography of the high alpine Triglav Lakes Valley, NW Slovenia, was studied by means of detailed mapping and stratigraphic study of the valley. The Triglav Lakes Valley is characterised by a generally asymmetric transverse (E--W) profile: a very steep eastern slope, a relatively flat valley and a relatively gentle western slope. On the transverse profile the valley floor is essentially flat, gently dipping towards the east. In the longitudinal cross-section, however, the valley floor is marked by sharply-defined fault blocks extending in a W--E to NW--SE direction. Additionally, the highest block (elevations ∼2100 m) is in the northern part of the valley, the lowest (elevations ∼1600 m) in the southern part of the valley. Our research shows that the Triglav Lakes Valley directly represents the topographic expression of Paleogene--Neogene thrusting and faulting, having recorded the following geomorphologic evolutionary stages: 1. an Oligocene to early Miocene W-vergent thrusting phase, with steep W-facing slopes of the eastern part of the valley directly representing the thrusting front; and 2. a Neogene-to-present strike--slip faulting in NNE--SSW direction with two bifurcating right-lateral strike--slip systems. We show that the Triglav Lakes Valley almost perfectly mimics the wedge-shaped damage zone located between these faults.},

	abstract = {Here we present the first U-series dated stable oxygen isotope record in continental Europe that covers the entire tripartite Penultimate Interglacial, i.e. Marine Isotope Stages 7.5 to 7.1. This record was obtained from a U-rich stalagmite from Spannagel Cave in the Austrian Alps which is largely devoid of kinetic isotope fractionation effects which comprised previously studied flowstone from this site. Composed of dense, columnar calcite this speleothem apparently grew without significant interruption for ca. 50 ka, albeit at a very slow rate. The age model was established based on 23 individual U/Th TIMS dates using a combination of a Bayesian approach, which includes additional information using stratigraphic constraints, and the mixed-effect regression model. The resulting record shows three prominent maxima in δ18O (MIS 7.5, 7.3 and 7.1) separated by a long earlier and a shorter later cold period (MIS 7.4 and 7.2, respectively). The mid points of the transitions into the three warm phases occurred at 240$\pm$3, 215$\pm$2 and 200$\pm$3 ka and the MIS 7/6 transition was dated to 190$\pm$3 ka. The timing of these climate transitions is supported by other samples from the same cave and agrees within analytical uncertainties with U/Th-dated evidence from corals, marine aragonitic sediments and submerged stalagmites, as well as with orbitally tuned deep-sea records. Good agreement was also found with new speleothem data from China as far as MIS 7.1 and 7.5 are concerned, whereas MIS 7.3 apparently started earlier and MIS 7.2 lasted longer than in the Alps. Comparing the European speleothem data with Antarctic ice cores reveals obvious differences in age (the latter suggesting an earlier start and a generally shorter duration of the three warm episodes). In essence, this study underscores the great potential of speleothems as accurate and precise chronometers of Pleistocene climate change and emphasizes the need for similar studies in other continents (including submerged caves) in order to improve the imperfect chronological framework of MIS 7.},

	abstract = {A new high-resolution stable isotope record from the alpine Kleegruben Cave (2165m, Central Alps) is presented. This record largely duplicates a previously reported speleothem record from this site. High-precision U-series thermal ionization mass spectrometry dates constrain the growth history of this new sample (56--48ka) to the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Both stalagmites reveal highly similar variations in O isotopes that can be directly compared to O isotope variability associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials recorded in the Greenland ice cores (Greenland Interstadials, GIS). Based on the new record we refine our previous age assignments of the GIS during this time interval, i.e. GIS 15b at 55.7ka, GIS 15a at 55.3ka, onset (mid-point) of the prominent GIS 14 at 54.5yr and onset of GIS 12 at ∼48ka. The overall uncertainties associated with these ages are 0.1--0.3ka. The timing of these Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials is within 0.2ka of the newly proposed GRIP.SFCP04 timescale. The age data for both Kleegruben stalagmites demonstrate that liquid water was at least seasonally present in the shallow sub-surface allowing calcite precipitation to continue even during stadials of MIS 3. Given the present-day low temperature (+2.4$\,^{\circ}$C) we propose that these unusual speleothems formed in a karst system overlain by a warm-based glacier.},

@inproceedings{10.1007/978-1-4419-9118-8_13,
	abstract = {Spannagel Cave is a fairly extensive cave system (currently nine kilometers of explored passages) which developed in Jurassic marbles sandwiched between gneiss in the western part of the Zillertal Alps, Tyrol. The cave system extends from 2195 m to 2521 m a.s.l. and is adjacent to the actively retreating Hintertux Glacier. Marginal moraines of the glacial advance during the ``Little Ice Age'' (about 1850) show that even fairly recently parts of the cave system were in a subglacial position. Despite its high altitude well above timber line, this cave hosts speleothems, some of which are actively forming today. Modern speleothem deposition includes stalactites, soda straws, stalagmites, moonmilk and flowstones, whereas the latter are the most abundant variety of ancient speleothems in this cave. Th-U TIMS dating demonstrates that speleothem deposition occurred repeatedly during the past few hundred thousand years at this site. Stable isotope data of modern and ancient speleothems yielded a large spread both in C (-11.1 to +10.8{\%}o VPDB) and O (-15.5 to -6.2{\%}o VPDB). The C isotope values are biased toward high and commonly positive values, reflecting a low proportion of soil-derived CO2 in the karst system, largely buffered by the host rock. C isotope values as high as +10.8{\%}o indicate kinetically controlled fractionation. Speleothems of Holocene age show O isotopic compositions consistent with near-equilibrium fractionation from modern dripwaters. In contrast, fossil speleothems commonly show lower O isotope values and higher and more variable C isotope values, reflecting the impact of isotopically depleted glacier meltwaters and the sensitivity of the karst system to changes in the high-alpine vegetation cover.},

	abstract = {We use the uranium-series (U-Th) dating method to investigate the accuracy of a relative chronology based on laminae correlation between a pair of coeval twin stalagmites and compare their stable isotope and trace element records based on the two chronologies. U-Th dating shows that a relative chronology based on laminae correlation can be inaccurate: a hiatus in one of the stalagmites was not recognised, as well as more subtle changes in growth rates. Use of the stratigraphic correlation alone resulted in significant differences in the timing of stable isotopes and trace element peaks, with implications for their interpretation. Our results reveal the importance of a robust and direct chronology with which to interpret proxy data. Poor relative chronologies can lead to a misinterpretation of palaeoclimate data. The study reveals potential implications for speleothem records where proxy data and samples for dating were not taken in close proximity to each other and/or were correlated via laminae over distances of more than a few centimetres.},

@article{columbu2018palaeoenvironmental,
	abstract = {Three stalagmites, which grew in the high altitude (~1800 m a.s.l.) Piani Eterni karst system (northern Italy), represent the longest speleothem palaeoclimate-environmental record from the southern Alps. U- Th dating shows their discontinuous formation during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 10, 8, 7d, 6 and 5deb, with carbonate deposition prevented during both full interglacial and full glacial stages. Speleothem formation was inhibited during interglacial peaks because local base level rise, connected to global climate changes, caused the alluviation of the main epiphreatic levels of the cave system. Drainage of the hydrological pathways, caused by the progressive decrease of rainfall and the accumulation of a perennial snow pack, stopped carbonate deposition during glacials. Thus, Piani Eterni speleothems function as indicators of transitional interglacial to glacial (IGeG) climate periods over the last ~400 thousand years (kyrs). Analysis of d18O and d13C suggest that: i) seasonal snow melt occurred in these high altitude terrains during IGeG times, allowing meteoric water to efficiently penetrate the karst network; ii) soils were restored during MIS 5ceb, but absent during MIS 10, 8, 7d and 6 due to denu- dation of the karst surfaces; and iii) rainfall perturbations modulated the IGeG shifts in the southern Alps. Rainfall variation is connected to solar radiation changes at orbital timescales during MIS 5ceb, and mimics Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) cycle variability during DO 23 and 22. DO cycle-like variability is also suspected during MIS 10, 8 and 6. The most important result is that, from a geochemical perspective, this study demonstrates that drivers of d18O in southern alpine speleothems are similar to Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Asian speleothems in that they are prevalently controlled by the rainfall amount effect. This contrasts with speleothem records from the more continental northern alpine sector where the air temperature effect on d18O of precipitation dominates.},

	abstract = {Abstract The interplay of temperature (air and substrata), humidity and air movement in caves, on a background of peculiar cave morphology, is responsible for the genesis, accumulation and dynamics of ice in caves. With few exceptions, the vast majority of ice caves occur in regions where the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) is well above 0$\,^{\circ}$C, the peculiar cave climate responsible for cave glaciations being the result of specific types of air circulation. The most important cooling mechanisms responsible for cave ice formation (and preservation) are cold air advection through gravitational settling and chimney effect. Gravitational occurs in single entrance, descending caves (or in caves with multiple entrances situated at roughly similar elevations) during winter months, when thermal differences between the external and internal air translate into cold air flow to the caves. Inflow of air into caves due to the chimney effect occurs in caves with multiple (at least two) entrances located at different altitudes, as a direct consequence of temperature contrast between the cave's atmosphere and the external environment. These differences result in a pressure gradient between the cave entrances, which in turn triggers airflow through the cave. A direct consequence of air circulation between caves and the outside environment is changes in temperature and humidity in their atmospheres and substrata. Fluctuations of cave air temperatures follow external ones in both dynamically ventilated caves (caves with two or more entrances) and cold-air traps, the amplitudes decreasing with increasing distance from the entrance. In cold air traps, during summer months, the external and cave environment are not connected via air circulation; conductive transfer through the air column in the entrance and the rock walls, as well as dripping water are the main heat sources for the cave atmosphere, while the latent heat consumed in thawing the ice and sensible heat responsible for warming ice and rock are the main heat sinks. Positive \{MAATs\} outside ice caves result in the underground glaciers to be in a sensitive equilibrium with external climatic conditions, continuously subjected to the risk of continuous melt. },
